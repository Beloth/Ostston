####Identification
Going to a magic shop. Shop keeper wants to see his guild identification. As he has none the shop keeper sighs at him. "Oh dear. 1st time outside the University without your sponsor is it? No.. hmm strange your sponsor should ahve gotten you guild identification. You'll need identification before I can give you any discount"

If Angus says you never needed it before. "Where have you been shopping? At one of those shops that isn't affliated with the guild?!?. Here in Ostston?" 

"Hmm HIghcastle was it.. well not my problem. But it'll be wise of you to report them but thats your call"

"Now for identification.. I can help you there for a small fee" Pointing to a display cabinat filled with various rings, amulets and trinkets "Just select one of these to be the basis of your identification then I'll talk to the Magistar to get your membership details"

After choosing the item he picks up a small hand mirror from beneath the desk. With a small arcane gesture  he calls out "Magistar of registration office" "This is Riley's Relics" and he holds up an amulet, which glows briefly, to the mirror. A voice comes from the mirror "How may I help Master Riley" "well it appears I have a Wizard here without the proper identification". He twists the mirror round so that its facing Angus

Old Female gnome. Grey hair tied in a bun. Half moon spectacles. Sitting behind a large desk with stacks of paper scattered around it. Several crystals in holders on the edge of the desk. She picks a clear one up and holds it infront of the mirror. "Name"
After giving his name:
There is a bright flash from the crystal that momentarily blinds Angus and anyone else in from of the mirror.
When his sight returns the crystal is back in the holder and a large opne book has appeared infront of the gnome and the pages are flickering rapidly and the stops. The gnome starts reading.

"Angus deSchwarz MAcDonnach hmmm"
"age 30"
"Sponsor Robert Caelom"
"Junior Lecturer on 'The magical embodiment in ancient architecture ... ' " ends in a mumble
"hmm that's strange there's a sealed note on your file 1 second please"
The mirror goes dark as some music is heard coming from the mirror.

See if party does anything

There is a bell ring from the back of the shop
After a time the gnome reappears "Right well I've sent the identification cystal to Riley's however Junior Lecturer MacDonnach you to return to the University." With that she hands off the mirror to a middle aged male human. "This senior investigator Ronon. There are issues with the investigation into the necromancer. You are to return to answer questions. You have 2 days" With that the connection closes down
