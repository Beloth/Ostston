###Imbuement

Forcing magic into an item. Brute force method of enchanting. Quick and dirty method of enchanting. Can lead to interesting results. The enchanter focuses on the outcome they want and pours their magical energy into the item they are enchanting. There is a chance that strange things happen, roll on wild magic table

####Pros
* Cost is less
* Time take less
* Can attempt any magical feat they can think of (eg doesn't have to be a known spell to them or in general)

####Cons
* Takes alot more magical energy (ie can only use spells that are half the max spell slot they have)
* Chance of wild magic to give the item an unintentional affect
* Not approved by the Sages of the Arcane outside their specialist research team

###Inscription
Enchanting through marking an item with magical rune/writing/designs.This method finesses magic into an item through carving, inlays, markings, etc of runes, writing, designs, etc into the item

####Pros
* Potential to be better than expected
* Less magic intensive
* Approved by the Sages of the Arcane

####Cons
* The cost of materials
* Takes more time
* Can only be done for magics the user knows of or has the designs for



###Equivalent levels of enchanting & difficulty
|Difficulty level|Spell level|Rarity|Weapon \ Armour  Bonus| Difficulty Modifier | Enchanting level required|
|----------------|-----------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
|0|Cantrip|Common| +1\*| 0| Untrained | 
|1|1-3|Uncommon| + 1| +2 | Initiate|
|2|4-6|Rare| +2| +4 | Adept| 
|3|7-8|Very Rare| +3 | +7 | Master|
|4|9|Legendary| +4 | +10 | Special|DM discretion|

\*Spell effect is only half power (ie spell duration halved, damage halved, either +1 to damage or attack, etc)  

This tables shows the highest level spell effect that the item should have in the form of a one per short rest. For example a Uncommon Sword enchanted with a level 1 Acid Splash spell will only cast Acid Splash 3 times before requiring a short rest. If the same Sword was made very rare but with the same spell the effect may occur more times before requiring a short rest

###Time

You can only magically craft for a certain length of time based on the number of spell slots you want to expend.

Time taken cannot be reduced to less than half the base time
* 1 day = 8 hours of crafting
* 1 week = 7 days
* 1 month = 4 weeks

####Basic
Time you can enchant - 1 hour per spell slot per level (eg expending a level 4 slot is 4 hours of enchanting)

One use items (eg ammunition) with non cantrips (eg +1 damage)
* 1 hour per item - 5 minutes per skill level

All other items 
* 8 hours per cantrip item - 30 minutes per skill level

####Imbuing
* Time you can enchant - 1 hour per spell slot per level (eg expending a level 4 slot is 4 hours of embuing)
* Overpowering - After 8 spell slot levels to get your 8 hours for the day, you can expend extra spell slots to overpower your embuing and speed up the process upto an additional 8 hours per day but at a higher cost - 1 hour per 2 spell slots per level (eg expending an extra level 4 slot is an extra 2 hours) 

#####One use items (eg ammunition)
