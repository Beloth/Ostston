##Ameria Malandel
###Level 10 Half Elven Sorceress

####Scheme  
Gain magical power via bargin with arch Devil in order to take over the mages guild

####Background

Daughter of the Headmistress of the Sages of the Arcane (Mages guild) and an Elven noble in Iradell. Lived with father as a child but was sent to the mages guild to learn "human" magic after not getting along with the elvish children. Mother paid little attention to her. She proved to be a prodgy in terms of magic but was often accused of being arrogent. Always compared to her mother but not in a good way. Somehow became advisor to Lord Tanafrey.

####Current Situation
Has made pact with the Arch Devil Meldar. She delivers 1000 souls and he will provide the Orb of Grekit and artifact that enables the user to extract the magicial ability from someone and give a portion of that power to the user (the rest of the power goes to the owner eg Arch Devil Meldar).

Worked with Lord Tanafrey to engineer the situation in Ostston in order to gather the 1000 souls. Currently at 800 souls. 

####Demenor

Clever. manipulative. Works from the shadows. Pretends to be on the side of good
