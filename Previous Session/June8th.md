##Session Write-up

###Into the portal and through the woods...
The party recover their thoughts as Cig is carried away, unconscious and invisible. Angus applies manacles to the sleeping assassin and then, in purging the remainder of the poison from his system, throws up all over him. They reveal his face and find that he has no tongue. Mal uses Detect thoughts and Angus slaps him awake and they begin to interrogate him. They get as far as finding out that Cig was to be returned to the Tinker, the old gnome that was in charge of part of the Thieves Guild. Before they can question him further a crossbow bolt strikes the assassin, killing him. They cannot see where it was fired from.

 

Meanwhile Little Claw, still wildshaped as a dire wolf, and Caid give chase to the fleeing assassins. Using their keen senses they are able to follow in their general direction of travel until they can hear sounds of fighting. Caid returns to Angus to inform him and he in turn informs Mal and Eli and the three give chase. Little Claw adopts a stealthy approach and leaps up to the rooftops. He observes a fight going on in an alleyway between the assassins and another group of rogue looking types.

 

Angus, Eli and Mal arrive at the alleyway and discover a dead assassin. They make their way through the alley and observe the fight, waiting for the time to move to save Cig. Little Claw attempts to leap across some roof tops to get closer but falls short, barely managing to hold on to the side of the opposing roof. There he changed shape into that of an ape and leapt down to where Cig lay, unconscious.

 

The fight ended with the new group killing off the last of the assassins and one rogue, a woman acting as their leader, imploring the Hand to stand down, offering peace and reviving Cig with smelling salts. She was recognised as being the Hand’s initial contact with the Thieves Guild and she reprimanded Cig for being so careless. She told the others to take the Hand somewhere safe to explain and then allowed herself to be punched to the face to make it look as though she had been involved in a struggle.

 

At a safe house the rogues explained that they were not from the city and that the woman was Katrina, known as The Cat. She was an agent for the guild master who over saw the whole guild in the city and that the gnome was but one of seven who ruled only a part of the city. The gnome was believed to be involved with the revival of the Shadow League. Cig revealed he knew more than he had previously shared.

 

The group returned to Springwell to collect their things before heading to The Anvil to rest in the barracks. The next day they were tracked by Arcanist Shinera who explained that they had made some break through with the orb in the sewers but they needed some agents to travel through the portal to Blackpine forest to investigate the other side. An old accord meant that no agent of Ostston could enter the forest so the Hand would allow them to circumvent that condition.

 

She made monies available for the Hand to resupply and after picking up some potions and equipment they headed for the portal.

 

Stepping through the portal they were immediately transported to a clearing within a forest that Eli judged to be Blackpine. They witnessed a demonic imp within the clearing transform in to a raven and fly north, Initially giving chase they realised that there were other demons in the clearing and a fight ensued. Two Bearded Devils wielding glaves, two imps and a human thug guarded an orb powered by blood magic feeding off 4 captive young boys who were chained to the device.

 

One Devil closed in on Angus and lashed out at him but his magical wards were enough to protect him. The other charged Little Claw who changed in to a bear shape and the two fought. With Angus’ withdrawal the Devil facing him closed on Eli and the Halfling was forced to drop her bow and take up the sword to defend herself whilst Mal and Cig provided support. The imps blinked in and out of invisibility, striking at Caid, dispelling her. After a while, with their attacks seemingly doing very little damage to the resistant Devils, the Hand was able to wear down the Devils though Eli took much damage. The first to fall was the Devil facing off against Little Claw. The next was the Thug who was obliterated by a miniature meteor flung by Angus. Eli continued to take damage as she, Mal, the Devil and an Imp performed a pirouetting battle. One Imp materialised behind Angus who was distracted casting a spell and stung him viciously, bringing him close to death. He responded by firing his wand of magic missiles at the imp, killing it.

 

After a short continuation of the fight the last Devil and Imp were finished off and the group turned their attentions to freeing the boys chained to the orb.

 

They were told by the boys that breaking the chains would kill them. They investigated and eventually identified the lock on the back of the boys’ collars and Cig and Eli were able to free them. However when the collars were removed the boys’ necks were revealed to have horrible wounds and Mal was required to step in and heal them. Once all the boys were freed they were taken back through the portal to be left in the care of Arcanist Shinera…

Tracking Cig's kidnappers

Survivability check

#####10+ takes about 15mins to find their trail  
The party finds Cig unconcious along with 3 bodies of the kidnappers. Around them are 3 people dressed in dark clothing, hoods up with with only theirs eys visable above the cloth covering the rest of their faces. 1 in kneeling is front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

#####15+ takes about 5-10 mins to find the trail  
The party finds Cig unconcious with 2 of the kidnappers dead and the last one being double teamed.  1 in kneeling is front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

#####20+ finds the trail quickly  
The party finds Cig unconcious with 1 dead assassin and 2 others being confronted by 3 cloaked people. After combat ends 1 kneels in front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

"Stand down" the kneeling woman says as you approach, "their his friends". They sheath their weapons but maintain their defesive positions. Cig comes to conciousness when the woman waves something under his nose. After a moment she helps Cig to his feet.

Cig roll perception check with disadvantage. Unless really high she takes the dagger that you had secreted on your person.

Once Cig is able to stand by himself she removes her hood and pulls down the cloth covering her mouth. You recognise her as the woman (Katrine) that you met you showed you to the meeting place for the thieves guild (and the tunnels).

Cig roll a perception check 10+ the other 2 are familiar to you, 15+ you recognise the other 2 as the ones that had followed you when you were looking for those scouts way back when

"You should have been more wary. Your description has been sent out to all and there has been talk of a hefty bounty for your head."

She turns and stands in front of one of the cloaked men.  

"Explain what you can. I need to get back... you know what to do..." as she hands him the dagger.

He nods. Before anyone can react he lashes out with his fist striking her across the jaw. He catches her before she can fall. She spits out some blood. 

If the party tries to intervene she holds out her hand "Stop. Its necessary... wouldn't want it to look like I got away without any damage..." She tries to wink at you but winces...

With that she braces herself and nods again at the cloaked man. He swipes at her with Cig's dagger causing a shallow wound. She gasps and covers the wound with her hands. 

She takes a breath, takes a breath "Right.. get going..." she stumbles down one of the side alleys.

"Follow us.. quietly" 

Everyone make a stealth roll. Group DC 10

The cloaked men lead back into the merchants quarters via the back alleys. They stop behind a general goods store where there are some large broken crates, bags and other assorted rubbish. You see then take a quick look around before reaching behind the rubblish and the whole lots seems to lift slightly and then swing outwards revealing stairs down. The 2 men enter... one walking swiftly down the stairs the other standing in the enterance and motioning you down with some urgency. 

TAs you head down you see a lantern has been lit and you enter a plain room which has a simple table and a couple of chairs as well as sleeping mats in 1 corner. There is a cuboard with a couple of shelves of what looks to be dried rations.

"We don't have much time but I can answer a couple of you questions" looking at Cig.

* The price on Cig's head came originally from the King of the Slums and hasn't be recinded
* However it was the Old Tinkerer ordered your capture, motivations unknown. In a way that was lucky as it allowed the Kat (Katrine) to run interferance
* She is their contact here, believe that although she is part of the Old Tinkerer's crew she actually works for the Ostston Guildmaster.
* Her benefactor wants to know who ordered Borivik's death but they can't be seen to be actively looking in this area.
* She has been told to aid you were possible without blowing her cover
* She doesn't think that the Ostston Guildmaster is involved
* The leaders of the various districts are scambling for power at the moment especially with the death of the the Slum Lord.
* Suggests to stay out of the Sewers for now. Not safe there for Cig and might not be safe for the rest of the Hand considering the Old Tinkerer knows of you now.
* Any chance of quietly investigating your friends death has been blown. At least within the Craftsman and Slum chapters of the guild. 
* Advice to lay low until the new leader of the Slums chapter is appointed.
 
Once all questions have been answered they lead you back out of the room.


####Arcahnist Shaniera
She meets you at the Springwell Inn. "Good morning. If I could have a moment of your time. I have arranged for a private room"

She leads you into a side room where a table and chairs for all of you has been setup. She closes the door and sits. Once you are all sat she retrieves what appears to be a golden egg from her robe and places it on the centre of the table. She touches it briefly with her finger and you see a slight spark of magical energy. The sides of the egg slide down lifting the the revealed gem higher off the table. It starts to pulse with a blue light and then therea column of blue energy the shoots upwards for about 4 feet and a dome apears around the table surronding you all.

"There now.. we should be safe from any magical or mudane eavesdroppers"

"I have finished my inital research into the portal and have found some disturbing informtion. Information I feel needs acting upon without the Marshal"

"It appears that you were correct. It is a portal to the Blackpine Forrest. That in itself is not a problem as there are several teleportation circles around the city alhtough none to Blackpine as far as I am aware. The fact that it was under the city in the hands of the some unknows however is a concern but something that we can deal with"

"The power orb is a whole different level. As you probably gathered it was created using blood magics but it wasn't used just to activate the portal, although that was one use. It looks like it was designed to be self sustaining once a certain level of power was reached. Once in that state it could then be used to power anything that could be linked to it and that is what I think its true purpose was. Some sort of heart stone. I have heard of such things, at the University for example there is said to be an imense potectiveheart stone that powers the wards. A heart stone powered by blood magics however... I cannot comprehend what that would be used for but I would not have been anything good.  I have begun the process of leeching the power from it slowly and purifing said energy, but it will take time to do so fully and is not without its risks.

"The fact that the portal and power orb was created under Ostston with out anyone noticing is also worring. That level of magics should have tripped every alarm, every wards that any mage had setup in Ostston. That it didn't means that someone or something powerful is behind it. In fact I can think of only a handful at most in the Sages that could have done it."

"And the questions remains, why Blackpine Forest, was it to bring something into Ostston or take something out of Ostston?"

"As I did not know much about Blackpine Forest I asked Belorn (the Steward) for whatever information the area that was avaliable. What I found was... interesting... Ostston apparently has a treaty in place, a very old treaty dating back to before Hestal was formed, infact before Ostston was a true city state. The treaty states that in return for help Lord Ost renouces all claims to the forest. A clause in the treaty also states that no agent of Ost may enter the forest without incurring a penalty. What that penalty is is obscurred by some powerful magic but next to the clause was a hand written note by Lord Ost himself claiming that the penalty was great and that none should risk it. 

In addition there was a clause that should they need more help Ost would to provide a harvest and help would be given. Below which was a large space and 2 dates. 109BU (Before Unification) and 18PU (Post Unification)"

** 109BU plague hits Ostston
** 18PU poor havest and famine hits Ostston

"Belorn also told me that the scroll the treaty is written on is one of the items that every Lord of Ostston must swear upon when they take up the mantle. The late Lord Gallentara took such an oath but his son has yet to take it. This swearing invokes some sort of magic but I have not yet managed to determine what it does."

"This brings us to you." She turns to Angus "You have sworn no oaths to Ostston and so are not an agent of Ostston" She stands up straighter more formal "As a representative of the Sages of the Arcane I request that you investigate the other side of the portal. Find out what is happening and why this portal has been setup. Will you do this?".

"I can use some of the remaining power of the orb to open the portal so that you do not have to walk there. I will also give you this signal gem to indicate that I should reopen it to let you through" She hands you a small blue gem that glows slightly. "Just hold it in your hand and think of me.. I will be notified and will open the portal... it is one use however"


### Heading towards the Portal
The house above the portal is being guarded by the city guard. As you head down you sen more guards stationed there plus several of the Archanists assistants. The Archanist greets you as you enter the Portal room.
The Orb is still glowing but less that before. You notice arryed around the orb are 4 stands each holding a red, faintly glowing gem and lines of energy attaching the gems to the orb similar to the lines of energy that had connected the flayed men but the energy direction seems to be towards the gems rather than the other way round. 

"Are you ready"

At that she touches a rune on each the stands and the lines of energy cease.  From her robes she pulls out another gem similiar to those in the stands but this time clear (eg not red) but glowing brighter. "A purified gem" she says. She holds the gem towards the orb and she bows her head in concentration. A beam of white light connects from the gem to the orb. After a moment a beam streaks from the orb to the portal. Unlike the last time you saw the beam this one is not bright red, more of a pale pink colour. The portal starts to open. 

Like heat distortion before it clears


###Forest Clearing

As the portal opens it reveals the same clearing you saw before however this time ther appears to be something there. A closer look shows a small winged creature in full view. 

Reveal the map

Before you can react it suddenly blinks into the form of a bird and flies away.


###Boys attached to the control orb
You seen 4 peasant boys attached to a metal ring around the stone base, by thin chains.
There is a thug holding one of the boys hostage. "Not one step closer or the boy gets it!" The boy is wimpering in fear. 
Little Claw you notice 1 of the other boys is using the distraction to inch closer to the thug, his hand under the rags pulling out a small knife.

He strikes the back of the thigh with the knife. The thugs roars out in surprise and pain, drops the boy and falls to the ground. The boy with the knife pull the other boy back and they bother back away as far as the chains allow. The thug turns and lunges for the boys

All get an attack of oppertunity

After you kill the thug the back away as from you as the chains allow, the one with the knife standing guard.

If they try to break the chains, 1 of the boys springs forward and stands between you and the chains with a hidden knife in his hands... "NO, if the chains are broken we die!"

Portal still open. No sounds transverse the
