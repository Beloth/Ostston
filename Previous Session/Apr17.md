###This Session
While alone Mal and Angus investigate the scoll left to Angus by Lady Granrus. They discover that it is a old manuscript, describing the levels of hell, that was copied from another version. Mal notes that it appears to have 2 of the levels mixed up (3rd and 5th). The next day they head to the Order of the Anvil to turn in their contract and become members of the guild. Rosanne confirms that the ey were successful and outlines the benefits of membership while handing them their reward. She also sends word to the High Marshal. They annouce that their group name is "The Hand".  

They then headed to the Temple of Moradin to see whether they have found a way of ridding Angus of the cursed Opal. They meet an old Dwarf call Dorn Runebrow who explained that the Opal is not strictly cursed but is part of a magical item set called "The gems of Sidruis". The opal is the slave gem and provides the master gem's owner the best characteristic of the owner of the slave. They were popular centuries ago with noblility who used them to improve their children and they were originally completely volunteery. However the extreme cost of them caused many shortcuts to be taken leading to the gem Angus currently holds were there where no safeguards in place. The clerics go on to describe the 2 possible methods of neutralising the curse. Either find the master gem and used that to remove the link or find someone who who take on the curse from Angus.  

All the party bar Angus head back to the mausoleum to look for the master gem. They find the mausoleum locked up and after Cig lockpicks the door they head in. Mal searches the urns but is disappointed only to find ashes. They head to the stairs to the lower part but find the tomb has been moved back to cover then and no amount of pushing will budge it. They remember that there seemed to be a mechanism to opening it and proceed to activate it. As they do they notice that there appears to be a growing glow around the tomb. They rush down to find that all the bodies have been moved and the area cleaned. As they head back to where they found the Opal they hear noises coming from the other tombs. Believing that they have tiggered the re-animation of more undead they rush forward and start searching for anything them missed the first time. Although the chests had been returned to the hidden room they were now empty. Also the 2 suits of armour had been returned to their upright position and they were starting to shake. Having seemly outstayed their welcome they rush to the exit attempting but failing to lock the door behind them.  

Meanwhile Angus headed to the slums in Ostston but just as he reached the outskirts he is turned away by the city guards. They inform him that the slums are dangerous at the moment as there seems to be a turf war going on and that he would be advised not to enter while they try to return order to the area. He turned away and searches for a begger in other parts of the city, which he finds Dorran. After a brief discussion he persuades him to take on the opal for a lump sum and a stippend. He takes him back to the temple while plying him with drink. Once there the clerics warn Angus of the danger of ritual but agree to go ahead with transferring it to Dorran. The clerics gather and lead by Runebrow the ritual starts. By expending his magic while the tendrils of the curse are moved from himself to Dorran, Angus manages to shield them both from some of the damage cause. However as each tendril is moved then amount of hurt caused increases and by the time the last tendril is moved, Dorran has past and Angus is at the brink of death. As the acolytes rush to aid the clerics and Runebrow who have been left exhusted by the ritual, Angus is lead out of the room to recover.  

The rest of the party return to discover what has happened. Insensed by what he percieved as Angus's lack of remorse over the death he caused, Little Claw lost himself and transformed into an Ape attempted to assault Angus. Unfortunately in his rage he misjudged the distance and failed to land a blow. Mal, seeing the city guard about to intervene casts sleep on Little Claw and drags him away. 

The next day they head to the palace to talk to the Marshal where they inform him of the undead in the tomb. He tells them that he has other people investigating the issue including Archanist Shaniera but at the moment leads are rather thin on the ground. He suggests that they start the investigating the toys they found where they rescued Caelom. They ask him to see if he could find Weester and he agrees to spread the word to the guard and get back to them. The Marshal also provides some knowledge of the disturbance in the Slums but is surprised when Angus suggests that it might be linked to the Shadow League. He confirms that while there is a thieves guild operating within the city there has been no evidences of a world wide organisation called the Shadow League. The Marshal is willing to give the party access to his own contact within the thieves guild, a silk merchant.  

Some of the party then try to find Weester. They stake out the home he disappeared in when being followed by Eli and Cig but find nothing. They then head to the safe house that he used to store a disguise. There they find a drunk man asleep, and after sombering him up they question him about Weester but gain no useful information.

####Cursed Opal

If taken the Opal binds to whoever carries it for more than 10mins. That person is then cursed. For 1 ability type there are at a disadvantage.

Too get rid of the curse. Greater Restoration. Temples will expect a donation equvalent of 500gp.

#####At the temple

This is senior archavist Dorn Runebrow. Very old Dwarf, grey hair, large gold rimmed glasses. Carrying a staff in one hand and a large tomb in the other.

He put the tomb on the table and peers at Angus
"So you are the one who found a gem of Sidruis are you. Hmm let me have a look at you." Before Angus can react he's grab Angus's ear and yanked him down till he's roughly at eye level and is peering at differnt parts of your face. Eventually he releases you  
"Hmm .. not too far gone then. It might not be impossible to do." He turns to the senior cleric "You best tell him what it entails. I'll begin gathering the necessary bits" With then he leaves the room.  

"Please forgive him.. he has served this temple faithfully for several centuries but has never been the most.. diplomatic"   
"The gems of Sidruis are not technically cursed gems. They were orginially manufactured for a particular reason." He looks at you all. "you didn't happen to find another piece of jewellary where you found that gem by any chance? A ring or amulet? Something with a magical link to the gem? No, pity, that would have made things easier."  

He looks at the tomb. "Where was I, ah yes, manufactured. As you probably have guessed the gems are vamperic by nature but originally not for a necessarily evil reason. They were linked to a master gem. As those people holding the slave gems lost attributes the one holding the master gem would gain them. Once the gem had drained all it could the magic left the gem. This usually left the holder dead or close to it. It was used as a method for noble or rich families to make their children stronger, fast, cleverer...

Now I know this sounds evil but the original design was for the slave gems to be purely voluntary. You could not be accidentally attuned for forced to be so. Once done the gem was left as payment with the family of the holder. 

However the exchange was not 1 to 1. So the recipent would of someone's strength would not be as strong as that person. The rate varied from 10 to 1 to 100 to 1. Not only that but the cost of preparing the gems was exsorbatant, and so as time went on corners were cut, which led to gems such as the one you hold where you had no choice in accepting it. This lead to the practice being seen as evil and dying out.

"So how do we get it off you.... well as far as we can tell there are 2 options, neither of which are very good...

Option 1. You find the master gem. With it we can break the link. Unfortunately the gem could be anywhere, be part of any type of jewellary, its magics forgotten.

Option 2. He looks down. Normally I would never suggest this but with the way things are at the moment there will probably be enough volunteers... We can try to transfer the gem to someone else. Without the master gem this will be difficult but not impossible. However the process will be very draining on both you and the other person. The volunteer will want compensation for this as it is likely to make their life very difficult. 

#####Volunteer

Noris. Late 30's human male. Crippled. Both legs and an arm crushed in a cavein at one of the mines to the north. The arm and one leg had to be amputated. Brought back to Ostston several weeks ago. Has a young family. Willing to take it on for a stippend for his family. Place 1000gp with the Bank of Ostston from which a monthly stippend will be paid. If the gem and be sold at the end then that can form part of the payment.

#####Ritual to remove the curse
Both placed on beds next to each other with the Opal on a table between them. You have to draw you magical energy inwards. Concentrate on pulling it away from the opal. Chanting starts up from the surrounding clerics. The light seems to dim and to your surprise to can actually see thin dark tendrils attaching Angus to the opal. The chants intensifies and a cleric steps closer to Angus and seems to manipulate one of the tendrils, pulling it away from Angus. It resists but with the cleric pulling at it, its seems to enlongate until part of it can reach Noris and when it does it snaps into place causing both to scream out in pain. 1D4 damage. The cleric almost collapses and he fails back with another taking his place. 

Each time another 1D4 damage. Expending a spell level will reduce the damage by half per die. Total 5 tendrils to remove.

Banging on the door and in bursts a young woman. Holding a small baby. "No Noris, please" she's stop by the clerics from interferring. "Please no" she is weeping and trying to reach for him. "I'm sorry my love but this is for the best, please take her outside.. she doesn't need to see this" Several helpers take her outside.
