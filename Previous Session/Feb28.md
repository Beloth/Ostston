#####If Angus tries to get a mage guild discount
Winyfred wants to see his guild identification. "Guild identification please". As he has none the shop keeper sighs at him. "Oh dear. 1st time outside the University without your sponsor is it? No.. hmm strange your sponsor should ahve gotten you guild identification. You'll need identification before I can give you any discount"

If Angus says you never needed it before. "Where have you been shopping? At a non-guild approved shop. Here in Ostston?"

"Hmm Highcastle was it.. well not my problem. But it'll be wise of you to report them but thats your call"

"Now for identification.. I can help you there for a small fee" Pointing to a display cabinat filled with various rings, amulets and trinkets "Just select one of these to be the basis of your identification then I'll talk to the Magistar to get your membership details"

After choosing the item she picks up a small hand mirror from beneath the desk. With a small arcane gesture he calls out "Magistar of registration office"  
"This is Winyfred's Wonderous Wares" and he holds up an amulet, which glows briefly, to the mirror. A voice comes from the mirror "How may I help Miss Winyfred" "well it appears I have a Wizard here without the proper identification".  
She twists the mirror round so that its facing Angus

Old Female gnome. Grey hair tied in a bun. Half moon spectacles. The mirror appears to be sitting on the desk that she is sitting behind. Several crystals in holders on the edge of the desk. She picks a clear one up and holds it infront of the mirror. "Name" After giving his name: There is a bright flash from the crystal that momentarily blinds Angus and anyone else in from of the mirror. When his sight returns the crystal is back in the holder and a large opne book has appeared infront of the gnome and the pages are flickering rapidly and the stops. The gnome starts reading.

"Angus deSchwarz MAcDonnach hmmm" "age 30" "Sponsor Robert Caelom" "Junior Lecturer on 'The magical embodiment in ancient architecture ... ' " ends in a mumble "hmm that's strange there's a sealed note on your file 1 second please" The mirror goes dark as some music is heard coming from the mirror.

See if party does anything

There is a bell ring from the back of the shop After a time the gnome reappears "Right well I've sent the identification cystal to Winyfred's however Investigator Ronon would like a word with Lecturer Macdonnach" With that she hands off the mirror to a middle aged male human. "This Senior investigator Ronon. There are issues with the investigation into the necromancer. You are to help the further investigation. It is good that you are in Ostston. Meet with Investigator Trent at the Library immediately"

####Library of Ostston
Large well maintain building with steps leading up to the front enterance. The entry hall has a curved desk with several people seat behind dealing with what appears to be paper work. As you approach one looks up    
"Can I help you?"

"Identification please"  

He consults another book. "Investigator Trent, yes of course. 1 second please" and he touches a blue crystal on the desk. A door to the side opens and a young man approches. "Please take Lecturer MacDonnach to room 18"  
"Yes Sir" He turn to you "Please follow me"  
He leads you to the door he just came through and proceeds to lead you through several hallways before stopping in front of a closed door. He knocks. "Lecturer MacDonnach and party for you"  

"Enter"

You enter the room to see a large table with various papers scattered all over it and 3 people appear to be shifting through them. 1 male human, 1 female elf and 1 male dragonborn

Angus recognises the Dragonborn as Rasvull a member of the Sages of the Arcane who had always been vocally opposed to your rise in the guild.

The human walks towards Angus. "Welcome, I am Investigator Trent, these are my companions Dalee and Rasvull."

"We went to investigate the Necorancer you recently defeated however when we found the cave in which you claim to have defeated him no traces of him or any magical ritual or any magic was found. Further more the farmer and his daughter you claim to have saved weren't there. No one it that area had ever heard of them"

"We wished to speak to your mentor Robert Caelom however he never responded to the summons. He was last sighted here in Ostston looking into rumours of a lost manuscript being found by one of the noble families. And by some conicidance you are here too...."

Rasvull "As I've said many time this upstart has lied through out. Making up claims to justify his advancement. I bet Caelom finally found out and this pack of thugs dealt with"

Dalee "There is no proof of that Ras. In fact there is no proof of anything, that is the most perplexing part of this."
She turns to you "So when was the last time you saw Robert?" 

"And you have had no contact since? None at all?"  

Rasvull "We should hold them. They are suspects in all of this"  
Dalee sighs "Ras, there is no evidence of any wrong doing by MacDonnach or any of his party. We can't not hold them"  
Trent "This is true. Be warned you will be watched and if you do anything against the guild charter you will be punished, you are free to go"  
Dalee "I will show them out"  
As you exit she puts her finger to her lips and motions for you to be silent and to follow her. She leads you towards the enterance but before getting there goes in a side room. "Apologies but I thought it best to talk to you outside the meeting. Rasvull has his own agenda and Trent, well lets just says is looking for advancement and so doesn't want to make waves"  
"Robert was a friend so I want to find out what has happened to him. While I can't order you to investigate, in fact as an Investigator on this case I would have to strongly suggest you stay out if it, it is not my fault if you accidentally found these notes" She takes some parchment out of her pockets and leaves it on a desk "and decided to take matters into your own hands" With that she winks and leaves the room
