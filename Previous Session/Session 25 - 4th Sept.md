##Session 25

Party heads back to the forest. They find a blood trail leading to the body of Rebel, the wolf companion of Eli's uncle Eldorin. They take the body to the den that they stayed with Eldorin during their 1st visit. Unfortunately Eldorin wasn't there so they bury Rebel. They then decide to head towards the lake. On the way there stumble across a fleeing mage who is being chased by Hell Wolves. After defeating the wolves they question the mage who gave lots of useful information including the fact that they are trying to raise the temple that is beneath the lake. They are also planning on to ambush a Dwarven caravan taking a Heart Stone to the University. The party decide to try to ambush the ambushers. They travel quickly avoiding as muuch confrontation as possible and enter the area where they believe the ambush would take place.

Description
Young male human, mid 20's, long brown hair, lose and all tangled. Beads of sweat rolling down his face. His robes were once of a fine material but now they are tattered and dirty, long rips and missing pieces, most of one sleave is missing probably having been caught on a tree as he was running

####Roland Zola
After defeating the wolves.  
He slumps to the ground, breathing heavily, obviously exhausted. He looks up to you.  
"Thank you, I can't thank you enough." He takes a deep breath "That should give me time to get away. You should leave too. If you're this deep in they'll kill you 1st and ask questions later"  
With that he tiredly clambers to his feet.

If questioned  
"Look.. I thank you for defeating them but I can tarry here. The longer I wait the more chance more will find my trail. They don't take lightly to people leaving."  

"I'm just an lowly appentice mage looking for a subject for my Duoklau dissitation (Angus - one of the many things a mages need to do to become a full fledged member of the Sages of the Arcane although he appears old to still be on his Duoklau, its one of the 1st steps)  

Insight check  

Nat 20 -  Obviously lying, you can see his eyes darting side to side and more beads of sweat appearing on his brow. He is also clutching what you believe to be his focus. He's obviously an appentice mage but the Duolane was not the reason he was here.
20+ Obviously lying, you can see his eyes darting side to side. He's obviously an appentice mage  
15+ He's lying but your not sure what about  
10+ He's not being totally honest with you but you don't know which is a lie and which is the truth    
10+ This is an unfortunate place and time to try to find a subject for his Duolane  

Perception check DC 15+
You see the edges of a tattoo under the torn sleave. You can make a grab for his arm to expose the tattoo. Grapple check (1D20)
If failed: "Hey.. get off me..." and he starts backing away from the party and looks ready to bolt
If success: As you lift the remains of the sleive away from his bicep you see the tattoo (previously seen on those who had taken over the tower)

Persuasion DC 13+ or Intimidation DC 10+  

"Look I know this doesn't look good but I can explain..... I was sent here to investigate what was going on. I'm the apprentice to Investigator Rensure. I need to get back to him to explain my findings. I'm sure if you let me go you'll be rewarded"

Insight check DC

20+ He's still lying to you. You get the feeling this is how he operates and probably why he's still an apprentice
15+ He's lying to you still
10+ Not totally being truthful.

Persuasion DC 13+ or Intimidation DC 10+  
"Ok.. ok... look. I am an apprentice in the Sage's of the Arcane, or maybe that should be I was an apprentice. But it was clear they didn't understand me... I mean look at me, 24 and still trying to pass my Duoklau. Most who joined with me are already on their Decklau or have already been made members.  After they rejected my 3rd attempt at Duoklau I was approached by Yandlar. She said she had seen what was being done with me and that those old windbags were purposely holding me back, that it had been done to others as well in order for them to retain their standing in the guild. That change was needed and that a movement had begun and that I could become a leading figure. It started small at first, just passing on gossip about fellow appentices, those who might struggle under the same restrictions that I did, those who might be aminable to change.

I thought nothing about it at first. I mean there are several movements going on at the University at all times. Its almost expected that you belong to a movement."

He leans in closer and whispers

"I mean, its rumoured that the leader of the movement was Ameria Mandel herself. I mean if the daughter of the headmistress was leading it, it can't be bad right?"

Back to his normal voice

"but I doubt that's true. I mean they lied about everything else. They finally got me back into the field and out of those boring lectures (he looks pointed at Angus at that point), but then the requests became more and more arduous, until I end up here.. in a cursed forrest, dealing with devil dogs and fanatical cultists worshiping some stone. I decided that this was not for me and waited for an oppertunity to leave"

He looks disgusted with himself.

"I should have known better..." He sighs "Look if I tell you everything I know will you let me go and not turn me in to the Sages? I'll head back and continue my studies and not cause any more trouble"

If the party agrees

"Ok.. we best move on though and find somewhere safe to hole up... more may be on my trail"

####What Roland knows

* Several groups working together. The break away mages, members taken from those who are unhappy with the Sages leadership. There is a cult group worshipping an Archdevil. A smaller group who seem to be mainly made up of Tieflings. The cultists and the devils seem to defer to the Teiflings but the mages leadership often clash with the Tieflings on what to do
* The mages are trying to access a temple that is rumoured to be under the lake. 
* The Cultist are intent on delivering souls to their devil masters
* Who knows what the Tieflings are trying to do.
* They are setting up orbs of power in 4 (NW, NE, SE, SW) locations around the lake. Once powered up they will opend a portal to the temple.
* They have built forts around the orbs, all but 1 is completed and are stockpiling material to repair the temple.
* Rumors are that the temple is not the end game. The temple will lead to another pocket dimension which the Archdevil wants to take over. That is the price he wants in order to grant the mages what they want. 
* Close to completing the final orb and fort but will take time to power up. The orb is vulnerable while not powered, its very fragile at that stage but it's probably well defended.
