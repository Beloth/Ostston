###Session 4 - 11th January 

Heading towards Hillard Fort the party encounters and defeat an Orge.
The party reached Hillard Fort. From the treeline they attempted to sneek up to the gate but unfortunately failed. Using Disguise Self Angus pretended to be a guard and managed to talk the gatekeeper (Len) into opening the gate at which point they captured him.   

After questioning him the party found that the Fort had been taken over by an unknown force which then took up a disguise of being guards and he and several others had also been hired to be pretend guards. However most of the fake guards had left a couple of days ago. Only the "Captain" Delgarion and a few other are left.  

The party sneaks into the tower fight the remaining fake guards and captian to the death. After a brief investigation they discover that the fake guards had been buying kidnapped people from the tribesmen and selling them goods (weapons, armour and trade goods) in return.

They are distracted by a large dust cloud moving towards the fort. They see a large number of tribemen running towards the fort. They close the gate and prepare to receive them but as the tribemen get closer they see that they are being chased by mounted guardsmen led by Lieutenant Jeffery who overtake and kill all the tribesmen. 

###Session 4 - 18th January

While the party rested Lieutenant Jeffery questioned the Gatekeeper Len. He confirmed that the man in the Captain's uniform is Delgarion. He was the person who hired him and several others to pretend to be guards. The party found out that the last lot of prisoners left only the day before

The tattoo was found on all the bodies within the tower but not on Len. They also checked the tribesman bodies but none seemed to have the tattoo. 

The party received a contract from Jeffery to retrieve the prisoners and well as a substantial reward for what they had already done. After taking some supplies as well as horses from the guards they set off after the prisoners with Eli tracking them.  

In the forest the party encountered an owlbear as well as a pack of mutated wolves while they rested which killed their horses.  

###Session 5 - 28th January

Found a clearing with some standing stones which redirected peoples focus away from them as well as not allowing the party see what was within the stones. Several attempts by Angus to see how the stones effect worked to no avail. The party through stones into the area between the stones  

They entered the area to find a stone alter and a portal. Several guards were there pushing the remaining prisoners through the portal. On the alter was a red pulsing crystal with a mage who's hand was on the crystal, bleeding.  

The party defeated the guards but before they could confront the mage 2 devils flew out of the portal heeding the call for help from the mage (called out to Meldar). The devils were also defeated but the mage used a spell to escape the party.  

The party appoached the crystal which had turned clear again. However when touched they were blasted away from the crystal which started pulsing red again and from which a voice began to speak with them. It claimed that they were not one of his.. not really but Mal felt a certain kinship to the voice. The voice then turned the party against each other whispering into their minds.  

Angus was brought to the brink of death by combination of stabbing and shooting by a dominated Mal and Eli respectively before Eli managed to shake off the mental intrusion and destroyed the crystal by shooting it.

Things found
  
  * Scroll of Protection from Fiends
  * A pouch with 4 Jasper gems
  
###Session 6 - 11th Febuary

The party attempted to track down the mage that disappeared. Angus found that the mage used dimension door to escape so they could not be more than 500ft away. Eli attempted to track the the mage while the rest of the party rested.  

Following the tracks the party finds a small clearing in which was a small glinting gem next to a burnt circle on the ground. Not trusting the gem Angus then used Mage hand to float the the gem off the ground. They found that as the gem was moved closer to people it would start to glow. As it was moved away the glow faded. After getting bored with the gem Angus used the mage hand to throw the gem to Cig at which point the gem exloded damaging those around it and signaling an attack by hell wolves.  

After defeating the wolves the party inspected the circle and it was determined to be a Teleportation cicle but the best Angus could work out was that it was to somewhere withing Hestal. The party decides to head to Ostston as they have been unable to rescue the villages but want to get word out about what is happening. They decide to head south 1st inorder to send a message to Lieutenant Jeffory via a animal messager.  

However as they move south the notice that they are being following and surrounded by more hell wolves, maybe even being herded. The party stumble into a clearing where 2 Owlbears are fighting a pack of Hell Wolves. They decide to take both sides on, initially taking on the wolves but then also the owlbears.

###Session 7 - 21th Febuary

The party reaches within 50 miles of Hillard Fort and Little Claw uses a bird as a messager to inform Lieutenant Jeffory of what had occured. They then make their way west and out of the forest. They notice that the opressive feel that had permiated the forest has died down a bit.  

Once out of the forest they attempt to head directly to Ostston but upon coming to a slightly hilly area they notice large camp fires. Scouting ahead Little Claw and Eli find that it is coming from what appears to be an Orc war camp that has taken advantage of the local troubles to setup.  

Trying to skirt around the area, they stumble across an Orc patrol. Though they defeated them one orc who ran away at the start managed to raise the alarm. The party decide that its safer to head to Wayfair Inn inorder to avoid the orc camp. They do so as the orcs do not seem keen on tracking them too far from the camp.  

At Wayfair Inn Angus and Mal get seriously drunk on free booze while Little Claw gets a free meal from the farmers wife. They also inform the Guard Sargent that is there of the orc camp and the Sargent sends a scouting group out to get more information.

The next day they head to Ostston. The party tries to get on board a merchant wagon but are refused. When they offer to provide fresh food the smaller members are allowed to ride on the wagons.
  
At Ostston they find an inn to stay at (Springwell Inn). Little Claw heads to the merchant quarters to send a letter to his father and Eli tags along. They find Winyfred's Wonderous Wares where Winyfred tells him that he can send a letter to the villages to the west for 6gp.

The rest of the party heads to the palace to try to tell the Marshal about what happened and get their reward. They finally get a meeting with the Marshal after Mal tells them of the "Important" mission they were on. After a discussion the Marshal asks them to be available to talk to the Council if required. The party agress and those members that are there are paid. Angus uses some magic to pretend to be Eli (a young male fighter) and successfully gets her share as well. 

###Session 8 - 21th Febuary

After a nights rest the party heads to Winyfred's where Angus attempts to find out whether Sages of the Arcane members get a discount. Winyfred demands to be shown guild identification which Angus appreantly didn't have. For a fee she organises for him to get identification by contacting the Magistar of Registration office which duly send a crystal to Winyfred's who combines it with an Owlbear claw that Angus has to from his identification. The Magistar notes that Angus has a note in his file and puts the party on hold. When she comes back Angus to asked to talk to a Senior Investigator Ronon who tells him that there are questions regarding his defeat of the necromancer and he has to go talk to Investigator Trent at the Library of Ostston.

While Angus heads to the Library, Mal heads to a lawyers office linked to his home town and the rest of the party attempts to get the remaining gold owed to them. Unfortunately they forget to take the contract and so are turned away. Little Claw and Eli head to the river to go fishing while Cig returns to the Inn. 

Mal meets the head laywer and shows him the tattoo found on the fake guards from Hillard Fort that may link them to Helgret. The laywer seem disturbed by this and agrees to investigate and to inform Mal's mother.

At the Library Angus meets Investigators Trent, Rasvull and Dalee who inform him that not only was there nothing in the necomancer cave except for a bear, the farmer and his daughter don't seem to exist and Angus's mentor Caelom is missing. Angus offers the handkerchief as proof but before Dalee can use any divination magic Rasvull accuses Angus of being involved but Trent refuses to arrest him. He also refuses to allow Angus to help investigate or to give him any information on the investigation and asks Dalee to show him out.

Before they exit Dalee leads him into a side room where she leaves her notes. Before exiting Angus asks her to to divine what she can from the handkerchief. She notices that there is already magic on it and that it appears to be a tracking spell and then leaves the room. Angus memorises whats on the notes and leaves the room, nodding to Dalee who is waiting down the hall. He remains in the Library doing research before being thrown out.

The next day Angus convinces the rest of the party to help him investigate the disappearance of Caelom. They agree but 1st they go to a merchant to resupply and by some new armour. Mal does the negociation and thinks he gets a good deal. Its not till he leaves the shop that he realises that the deal was not as good as he 1st thought.  Angus and Mal head to the Library to buy some scrolls where Angus swaps a future favour for a discount. They rest of the party take the contract and get their final gold.

They then meet up and head to the last place in Ostston Caelom was seen, the Jolly Workman inn where Angus and Mal talk to the innkeeper who confirm that Caelom was there and that he had a well dressed visitor the day before he was last seen. Cig is signalled to by Betsy the barmaid to meet her outside. He follows with Eli going invisible and Little C mousing, Betsy was willing to give him more information on Caelom for a price. He pays and while she is giving the information she is caught trying to pickpicket him.

They reenter the inn where Angus uses magic to convince the innkeeper to show them Caelom's room and open it. Little C changes into a bloodhound to find Caelom's scent. In there they find a book of Caeloms as well as directions.
