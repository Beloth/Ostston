###11th January 

The party reached Hillard Fort. From the treeline they attempted to sneek up to the gate but unfortunately failed. Using Disguise Self Angus pretended to be a guard and managed to talk the gatekeeper (Len) into opening the gate at which point they captured him.   
After questioning him the party found that most of the fake guards had left a couple of days ago. Only the "Captain" Delgarion and a few other are left.  
The party sneaks into the tower fight the remaining fake guards and captian to the death. Afterwhich they are distracted by a large dust cloud moving towards the fort. They see a large number of tribemen running towards the fort. They close the gate and prepare to receive them but as the tribemen get closer they see that they are being chased by mounted guardsmen led by Lieutenant Jeffery who overtake and kill all the tribesmen. 

###18th January

While the party rested Lieutenant Jeffery questioned the Gatekeeper Len. He confirmed that the man in the Captain's uniform is Delgarion. He was the person who hired him and several others to pretend to be guards. The party found out that the last lot of prisoners left only the day before

The tattoo was found on all the bodies within the tower but not on Len. They also checked the tribesman bodies but none seemed to have the tattoo. 

The party received a contract from Jeffery to retrieve the prisoners and well as a substantial reward for what they had already done. After taking some supplies as well as horses from the guards they set off after the prisoners with Eli tracking them.  

In the forest the party encountered an owlbear as well as a pack of mutated wolves while they rested which killed their horses.  

###28th January

Found a clearing with some standing stones which redirected peoples focus away from them as well as not allowing the party see what was within the stones. Several attempts by Angus to see how the stones effect worked to no avail. The party through stones into the area between the stones  
They entered the area to find a stone alter and a portal. Several guards were there pushing the remaining prisoners through the portal. On the alter was a red pulsing crystal with a mage who's hand was on the crystal, bleeding.  
The party defeated the guards but before they could confront the mage 2 devils flew out of the portal heeding the call for help from the mage (called out to Meldar).  
The devils were also defeated but the mage used a spell to escape the party.  
The party appoached the crystal which had turned clear again. However when touched they were blasted away from the crystal which started pulsing red again and from which a voice began to speak with them.  
It claimed that they were not one of his.. not really but Mal felt a certain kinship to the voice. The voice then turned the party against each other whispering into their minds.  
Angus was knocked unconsious by a combination of Mal and Eli who had shaken off the voice's influence. Eli then proceeded to destroy the crystal by shooting it.
