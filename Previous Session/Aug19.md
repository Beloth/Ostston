After finishing questioning Pelarna, the party decides to rest up. They set a cuople of the enslaved guards to watch Pelarna in the store room while the rest are used as looksouts while the the party rests. Angus and Mal are awoken by a thud coming from the storeroom and as the emerge they see Pelarna fleeing. As she takes flight Angus managed to get off a spell but she manages to shrug the damage off before escaping his range. Angus sends Caid to follow until she meets up with something. With that the party decides its a good time to leave. They gather the slaves up andbut before they march them back to the portal, Eli sneaks forward to take out the ravens believed to be imp in disguise.

They force march the slaves towards portal but after sometime they are tracked down by a pack of hell wolves which they defeat. As they continue to march through the night Little Claw noticed that they are being trailed by more hell wolves which proceed to deploy hit and run tactics killing several of the slaves. During one of these hits, Mal takes it upon himself to rugby tackle the wolf on the way out killing the wolf and stopping any further loses. 

As the party closes on the portal clear they notice another grey furred animal trailing them. After some disagreement the party ignores it as some believe it maybe the companion of Eli's uncle. They reach the portal without further incident and Angus calls upon the Archanist Shaniera to open the portal via the stone given to him. After a short wait the portal is opened and the party and slaves escape back to Ostston.

Once there tey hand over the slaves to Shaniera and informs her of what they have been up to. They agree to return and investigate further but the Archanist tells them that it'll take roughly 48 hours until the stone is recharged. She also agrees to gather some supplies from her personal collection for them.
