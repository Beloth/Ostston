####Silk Merchant
Enter a very richly decorated store. Several manikins with silk robes and dresses, selves packed with rolls of silk of various colours, displays with silk ribbons. Several customers being helped by shop assistants. A very rich looking female standing in front of a mirror drapped is a rather lurid pink being attended by a young human male. As you move into the shop you catch some of what he is saying:

"The colour looks magnificent with you're complextion, it really brings out that healthy glow of your skin". As he spots Mal, "Ah there you are" He turns back to the female "Please excuse me, this young gentleman has an order for his bride to be" He waves to one of the free assistants. "Cheral please continue to help this young lady" Smiling he loops his arm around Mal's and leads him towards the back of the shop "Your wife to be will love this... its a beautiful pale blue showing off all the right things, you'll be the envy of all your friends... "  

Once your in the back he drops his smile and unhooks his arm. Putting his finger to his lips he beckons you to follow him. He leads you to a small office and once the door is close slides a small panel across and reaches in. "There, we won't be overhead for a bit". He moves to a cupboard where he takes out a box wrapped in a pale blue bow as well as a short ribbon of the same colour.  

Perception check DC15 see a small rune stone inside with is now glowing slightly.

"I don't know why you want to contact the Thieves guild and I don't want to know. All you have to do is walk through the central market with this box and a pouch with whatever message you want the guild to have inside and tied with this ribbon. The message with reach the guild and if they like what the message says you'll be contacted"

"Best get back" He leads you back to the shop floor and as you get back out "A pleasure as always and please remember to come back if you or you lovely young lady are is need of anything else" He heads back to the previous customer.

####Thieves guild

Old gnome sitting behind a desk. Round glasses pearched on his nose. Seems to be going through a ledger. Perception check to see that it appears to be columns of accounts. Money coming in from various gangs and their payment.  

"Shadow League!" he shouts. The guards perk up and you see them stare at you, hands on their weapons, they are ready to attack on the gnomes order. He sighs "There isn't a Shadow league but some fool has started getting some people together and calling themselve the Shadow League. And now some rich fool gets off'ed there's suddenly a grand conspircy and the Shadow League is responsible. Do you know how badly this will affect business! Bah of course you don't. As if I didn't have enough trouble with those rufflers in the slums"   

"Hmmm" he peers at you though his glasses "Maybe we will be able to help each other. This gang calling themselves the Shadow League have holed up in the slums. We don't know whether they have taken over the Slumies or working with them. They have removed everyone we have sent in to check on them. Whats worse is they have sealed all of the underground ways into the slums. All but one... but this one must be guarded by something as everyone one we have sent have dissappeared.
