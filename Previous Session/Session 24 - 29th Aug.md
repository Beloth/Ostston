Session 24

Angus split from the group as they headed for the Anvil, he went to the Library where to proceeded to the Scroll shop he had previously visited. Before he could talk to the clerk at the desk he is interupted by a loud voice coming from the back storeroom. He overhears that the last shipped to the Library was missing all the items the Senior Scribe wanted. He talks to the Senior Scribe to find that the merchant that usually bring the goods from the University is named Taniera, a half orc merchant who swears that he brought everything he was told to. 



#### Back in Ostston

#####Library
At the scroll shop

You enter the shop to find a young half elven woman currently manning the counter. She appears quite nervous, her eyes darting to the closed door that leads to the storeroom. She smiles nervously at you and looks like she is about to greet you when shouting can be heard from the storeroom.

"Listen to me you poor excuse for a ..... I'm telling you they never arrived. We need more to be sent, stocks are dangerously low."

There a pause

"Now listen here. I would be pretty stupid to try stealing the supplies you sent here and the report it to you and demand more. Do I look stupid to you?!!?"

Another pause

"Why you little shit. I am a senior scribe of the Sages of the Arcane you jumped up son of a merchant. You will gather replacement supplies and send them at once or your supervisor will be informed of your obstructive nature!"

You hear thud of a fist hitting wood which causes the young woman to jump and then again with the door crashes open. Out storms a middle aged female human. She is carrying several scrolls and muttering to herself. She practically throws the scrolls to the young clerk. "Here are the last of them. File them away!"

The half elf clutches them and tries a half curtsy slash bob of the head and scurries to do her bidding.

The Senior Scribe sees you "And what do you want!"

There is a lake to the South west where there is a plant need to produce the special inks needed for magical scrolls. If the poarty were to go there and gather some she would offer a large discout on several scrolls (Max 25% depending on haggle and amount of plants found) plus one scroll for free (within reason, level 2) or 200gp. She gives a description of the leaves that grow on the edge of the lake / just in the lake. The leaves long and thin with green on the topside and purple underneath. Needs to be stored within a jar or other container with water from the lake.

[Goods she has](https://github.com/Beloth/Ostston/blob/master/Locations/Ostston/places/Winyfred's%20Wonderous%20Wares.md)

I'm afraid I haven't had alot of new stock. Supplies haven't been coming in. People have started to hoard causing prices to rise further. Its even start to affect the basics like food. Unrest is growing in Ostston There has been talk of a petition to the council by several merchants.
