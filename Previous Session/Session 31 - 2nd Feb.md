##Session 31 - 2nd Feb


* The party cotinued to explore the temple. You came across a Large, solid metal door with no visible locks. After investigating the door, Archanist Shaniera spots magical writing that seems to be protecting the door.
* At the same time she notices that there is similar writing on the walls that are more faded than those on the doors. You think this writing is linked to the shield preventing the ghosts from entering this level of the temple. 
* Clusters of the writing are also found that seems to be powering the enchantment and after a while Shaniera manages to untangle the cluster. She postulates that if you destory 5-6 of the clusters this my reduce the shield enough to allow the ghosts access.
* Continuing on you entered a room which not only contain the captain of the Lord Tanafrey's personal guard but also uncovered a hidden teleporter.
* The teleporter took you to a set of rooms that contained a small treasure room as well as a small shrine at which you made several offerings to Meliekki.
* You then found a cell with a beaten up Polarna. After questioning her you release her on the condition she tells you everything she knows about this place and the plans taking place.
* After trying to take her with you, her injured state slows you down to such an extent you decide to send her back to a safe area to wait.
* You also decide to send Shaniera back though the explored areas to disable any cluster you passed by.
* You find the last secret passage way that leads to the central room and open the door to reveal...
