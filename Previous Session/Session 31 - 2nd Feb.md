##Session 31 - 2nd Feb


* The party cotinued to explore the temple. You came across a Large, solid metal door with no visible locks. After investigating the door, Archanist Shaniera spots magical writing that seems to be protecting the door.
* At the same time she notices that there is similar writing on the walls that are more faded than those on the doors. You think this writing is linked to the shield preventing the ghosts from entering this level of the temple. 
* Clusters of the writing are also found that seems to be powering the enchantment and after a while Shaniera manages to untangle the cluster. She postulates that if you destory 5-6 of the clusters this my reduce the shield enough to allow the ghosts access.
* Continuing on you entered a room which not only contain the captain of the Lord Tanafrey's personal guard but also uncovered a hidden teleporter.
* The teleporter took you to a set of rooms that contained a small treasure room as well as a small shrine at which you made several offerings to Meliekki.
* You then found a cell with a beaten up Polarna. After questioning her you release her on the condition she tells you everything she knows about this place and the plans taking place.
* After trying to take her with you, her injured state slows you down to such an extent you decide to send her back to a safe area to wait.
* You also decide to send Shaniera back though the explored areas to disable any cluster you passed by.
* You find the last secret passage way that leads to the central room and open the door to reveal...


####Runes blocking the ghosts
* The walls have runes carved in the stone that make up the barrier stopping the ghosts from getting through. They are old however and partially hidden by the dirt and moss growth that has occurred. Runes are infernal in nature
* Perception Check DC 15+ to spot the runes if not looking for them or Investigation check DC 10+ if actively looking
* Arcana check 
  * 10+ old runes that appear to be designed to keep things out
  * 15+ They were designed to keep everything out including you. Must have weaken over time
  * 20+ Given a few more months, at most a year, they will have degraded enough that the ghost could probably have breached it.
* In order to break it down completely you need to find the power clusters. 
  * Investigation check
    * 10+ You spot a cluster 
    * 15+ You spot mulitple clusters
    
* If Shaniera has her gear she will spend some investigating. She pulls a small notebook from her pouch with a quill and ink pot and begins taking notes. She spends a good 10 minutes ignoring the party if you try to speak to her. She is totally absorbed with the runes.
  * If they touch her to get her attention. "Hmmm.. yes.. what is it? Oh yes right.. sorry... but these runes are ancient. I don't think if come across anything so old in some time. They are older than the ones on the door. You can see the relationship between the 2 though." and she starts pointing out various similarities between the door and wall runes.      I'll need a bit of time but I think I can work out how to deactive them.

* Breaking 1 power cluster weakens the barrier in that section. Need to break several (at least 4 out of the 9) inorder to alow the ghosts through

####Door 1
* Solid metal door.
  * Investigation
    * DC5 - No lock, no handle.
    * DC10 - Newly installed door 
    * DC15 - Doesn't seem to be any obvious method of opening the door
    * DC20+ - As you inspect the door more closely you can just about make out some sort of markings on the door. It looks almost like some sort of symbol. 
      * If Mal inspects it intelligance/arcana check DC10+. Appears to be related to the infernal language. You can gather the basic gist of it. Protection or defense 
      * Anyone else DC 15+. Appears to be related to the infernal language. You can gather the basic gist of it. Protection or defense 
      * Failed check - definitely magical but you're not sure what.
    
  * Attempting to open the door. No lock no handle so how are you trying?
    * Pushing on the door make a strength check. No matter the roll no affect. If high roll (25+) you push so hard you actually do damage to yourself (1D4 damage)
    * Attacking the door physically. Roll attack AC 10+. If hit roll damage - as soon as you make contact with the door an explosion of force erupts. 
      * Everyone within 10 feet of the door make a Dex save closest DC15+, next DC10. Success takes half damage. Damage = 2xDamage rolled.
    * Attacking the door with magic. As you release the magic you see writing start to light up. Shaniera's eyes widen and she shouts out "RUN". Everyone within 30 feet of the door make a Dex saving room. Closest DC17, next 15, next 13, next 11, etc. Anyone successful manages to scramble out of the way. All that fail take 2D6 magical force damage and are knocked prone. 
  
  * If the writing is spotted and mentioned then Shaniera will have a look. She takes out from a small pouch at her side what looks like a eye monocle. She places it in her eye and takes a close look. "Hmmm obviously magic, recently empowered. Looks like someone doesn't want anyone entering in here." 
    * If they haven't seen the runes that block the ghosts this is the point at which Shaniera will point them out.
      * She turns away from the door, hand half way to take off the monocle, then stops and stares at the wall. Her eyes widen and she approaches the wall. "There's more writing here, more faded" She starts tracing her finger along the wall, deep in thought.
      * Investigation DC 10+ to spot the runes. See [above] (#runes-blocking-the-ghosts)
      
####Cell with Pelarna

You find another room that seem to have been converted into a cell. Within is a female tiefling whose hands have been manacled together above her head, linked to a heavy duty chain that has tied to the ceiling. What was once leather armour lay in tatters against her skin and you can see deep discolouration all over her exposed skin. Her head is bowed and you can't see her face.

As she hears you open the door, with out looking up she says "Back for more are you, you sick bastards. I told you I don't know anything more..."

She raises her head and you she that her face is badly bruised and her eyes have swollen to such and extent that she can barely open them. You can however recognise her as Pelarna, the half sister of Mal.

You hear an odd weezing noise coming from her which after a moment you realise is a fatalistic type of laughter. "Just my luck, I get found by you. Take a good long look at what you have cost me."

As you get closer you catch a glimse of her back. You see deep lacerations (medical check dc10 - whip marks) and most noticably where there were large leathery wings there are now just broken and bleeding stubs.

If released she will collapse (make a dex roll to see if you can catch her before she falls to the ground).

####Guardroom
* Guard captain is recognisable as the captain of Lord Tanafrey. He does have the tattoo.
* Investigation check to find the runic circle 
  * If checking the bookcases DC20+
  * If checking the room DC15+
  * Drudic knowledge - symbols of transportation, leads to a hidden area. Probably not found by the cultists judging from the dust
  
####Private Melikki shrine Area

* Chest has
  * Amulet of Common Speech
  * Bag of Bean - 8 beans. weighs about 4lbs
  * 750gp art object - Silver Unicorn with sapphire eyes and a goldern horn
