After the rescue of Jooves, the party split up with Mal, Eli and Little Claw accompanying the clerics and Jooves back to the temple of Torm. Mal attempted to talk to a senior cleric order to get the Lady Granrus resurrected so that she could answer some questions for him, however he was rebuffed.

The rest of the party returned to the inn they stayed in the night before. Caelom by this stage was awake and Angus filled him in on the situation. He decided that he needed to make a report to the Sages of the Arcane and so insisted they head to the Library. Caid was sent to try to indicate to the other half of the party to meet them at the Library.

They were shown into a room to see both Investigator Trent and Rasvull and was asked to give their report. Rasvull was dismissive of the report, seeing it as more lies from Caelom and while both Angus and Little Claw attempted to confirm the truthfulness of the report it wasn’t until Caelom stood up and displayed the scarring from the tortures he had gone through that Rasvull believed. Trent then insisted that Caelom returned to the University with him to report directly to Senior Investigator Ronan.

The party returned to the Springwell in where Angus asked the innkeeper if he could send a message to Lord Darrel to warn him about the possible danger he may be in. As he did this the innkeeper hands over a message that had come for the party during the last couple of days. It was a summons to report to the City Council on their part in solving the Hill Tribe troubles the next day.

During the brief down time, Mal went to see his contact in the lawyer’s office but found he had taken a leave of absence. Eli stitched together the pelts of the Dire Wolves into a cloak for Angus. After testing it was found that in its current state fire would not damage the cloak but the person under it was not so lucky.

The next day they met with the Council led by the regent of the city Lady Gallentara. After describing their actions over the last couple of weeks they got to see the High Marshal Felarn and Lord Tanafrey argue over who was responsible and what should be done. Lady Gallentara grew tired of the argument and sent the High Marshal away to escort the party out and provide an additional reward.

The High Marshal took the party to his offices where he explained he would like to be able to call upon additional resources such as the party who has no direct ties to the city but without being affiliated with the Order of the Anvil he would not be able to do so. In order to help the party gain membership more quickly he produced a letter of introduction to the Mistress of Contracts, a Lady Roseanna.

After going to the Order of the Anvil they meet with Roseanne a female Halfling who explains the way contracts work within the Order and how given the introductory letter from the High Marshal the party would be allowed to join the guild after a simple contract completion whilst being evaluated by a senior Order member. The party was asked to clean out a local Mausoleum where several servants had gone missing after being sent to prepare it for family burial. They would be joined by a cleric of Torm called Thorath Ironshield.

The next day they went to said mausoleum, with Thorath, which was about an hour north of the city. The rest of the cemetery seemed normal but as they approach the mausoleum the atmosphere changed. They noticed that the entrance door had been picked. Entering they saw a large statue (Eldath Goddess of peace) at which Thorath said a prayer and made an offering. 

As they explored this level of the mausoleum they discover little out of place until they reach the rear, where they find a crypt had been moved to reveal some stairs down. As they make this discovery a group of 4 skeletons appear. After easily handling them the party descends down where they find a dead body.

Angus sends Caid out to scout the corridors where she bumps into 4 zombies who follow her back to the party. While dealing with these zombies 2 more skeletons are drawn to the fray. After they defeat them the party explores several of the rooms where they occasionally meet some groups of skeletons.

As they make their way further in, Angus, Caid and Cig unknowingly trigger a trapped statue and while Angus and Cig manage to dive out of the way mitigating some of the damage, Caid is hit with the full force of the stone sword and is sent back to the ether. Cig then attempts to disarm the trap but fails and is hit again. Using the time before the trap resets the rest of the party rush past the trap. 

In the next room they setup for trouble and trouble they find with a mummy waiting for them. Thorath rushes to the front to do his duty in defeating undead but is hit with the mummy’s rotting fist and is visibly affect by more than just the force of the blow. Despite this he is able to cast Turn Undead forcing the mummy to flee to the back of the room where the party was able to hit it with ranged attack after ranged attack to destroy it. 

Angus urges Thorath to stay back to allow the party to show him what they are made of. As this happens 2 more skeletons attacks the party drawn by the noise of the previous fight but they are no match for the party.

The next room they encounter is a larger room with a wight and several zombies. Eli moves to the front and hits the bunched up enemies with a Hail of Thorns but this leaves her exposed in the doorway to the wight’s counter attack. His initial attempt to reach out an touch her failed but this only fueled his rage and the living and with a mighty swing of his longsword catches Eli with a great hit. 

The zombies while not doing a lot of damage manages to distract the party briefly by their unwillingness to know when they are defeated.  The wight is pushed back into the room with Angus’s Flaming Sphere. Eli once again rushes to the front avoiding a blow by a zombie in the attempt to finish off the wight but misjudges how injured it was and again is left to face its counter attack. 

Little Claw in his bear form guards Thorath who having not recovered from the encounter with the mummy was staying near the back just in time to face several more zombies who had exited the room from a second exit. Little Claw made short work of them as Thorath moved to the centre of the party to lend some healing to those that required it. Failing to avoid the rolling flaming sphere the wight screamed as it is finally comsumed by fire. Between them the party defeats the rest of the zombies.

####Summons to the council
Returning to the Springwell Inn they recieve a summons to the council to explain the situation in 2 days time.  
They are escorted through the busy hallways by 2 guards. Lots of people wlking though the hallways, servants, guards and others. You are lead into what appears to be a throne room where there appears to be a queue to one of the side doors on the other side to which you are being lead

Perception check (DC18+)  
You notice a figure hiding in the shadows that appears to be watching you

you enter what seems to be a waiting room where 2 guards stand by the door. A clerk sits at a desk and motions to some seats. Please take a seat the council will see you soon  

Perception check

* 10+ you hear raised voices but can't really make out what is being said  
* 15+ their is an obvious disagreement within the council. Several are disbelieving . Also hear talking about the death of the son of the merchant Athar. He is raising a fuse and a proper investigation should be done.
* 20+ Male voice seems to be the most veriment in his disbelieve and calls into question the envidence  

####Council Room
Well appointed room with high ceilings and a large glass window letting in a lot of light. Large rectangle table dominated the room arround which sits the council. At the head is Lady Gellantara, Lord Tanafrey, Steward Belorn and Archanist Shaniera on her right and Priestess Val'oren, High Merchant Xavier and High Marshal Felarn on her left.

High Marshal Felarn stands and introduces you to them. Lady Gellantara and councillors this is the party who brought news of Hillards fall and the portal to which our subjects were taken through.

"Hmm they don't look like much." The figure sitting at the right hand of Lady Gallentara (Lord Tanafrey)  
"Their tale matches with the reports I'm getting" replies Felarn  
"Reports that are obviously too late for us to do anything about" retorts Tanafrey  
"And the Marshal of Highcastle will pay for his incompetancy. You was it that pushed for his promotion in the 1st place!"  
"Why you..." Tanafrey looks to stand  
"Enough!" shouts Lady G "Enough this arguing will get us no where"  
"Agreed" the female half elf. "perhaps questioning this party would be a better use of our time than rehashing old arguments"  
She turns to you "tell me of this portal and the one who held it open"  

Lady G
"Thank you for your time... you will receive a bonus.. High Marshal Felarn please take care of it and show them out" A clear dismissal of Felarn. Tanafrey looks smug  

Felarn walks you out and takes a pouch from the clerks desk. "Follow me." He takes you to what is obviously his office. Gives you the pouch (holds a further 500gp)  
"I had hoped the council will allow me to boost the number of guards due to your testimony but Tanafrey obviously has the ear of Lady G at the moment and has blocked that. I can't afford to go directly against him at this time."  
"If you are interested I may have jobs for you in the future, but I will need to wait a while otherwise it would be too obvious. That is if you are interested?"

"In the mean time if you are looking for work you could head to the Order of the Anvil. I'll write you an introductory note which will get you a meeting with Roszana who is incharge of the handing out the contracts.

####Exploring the Merchant Quarter
If the prosperity of a city can be determine by the amount and varity of the goods sold by it merchants that by all accounts Ostston is a very prosperous place. There are merchants here selling everything from spices to furniture to magic items.

Perceptions check 
* 10+ the is a subtle undercurrent of worry
* 15+ Though there still appears to be many things on sale there does seem to be a number of empty shelves

After a time exploring

Angus make a perception check

* 10+ You think you saw somthing important but you don't know what or why
* 15+ You saw something in one of the shop windows that bugs you. Thinking back and using your keen mind you recall the shop selling wooden items, chairs, tables, musical insturments, wait, there it is, the whistle, exactly the same style as Eli's.

####Order of the Anvil

As you approch it is less of a guild hall and more of a massive stone fortification 3 stories high. 2 heavily armed guards stand at the side of the thick open wooden doors. You can see several guards standing on the roof looking down.

You enter a large central hall which is busy with people. Several desks are at the sides manned by clerks with queues of people waiting to talk to them. Many large notice boards are scattered around the hall with what appears to be little notes pinned to them. There are clusters of people around the boards looking at the notes and a few taking some down.  

Several clerks holding piles of notes walk through the hall putting new notes onto the various boards.  
One of these clerks walks by you and stops "You look lost. Can I help you?"

"This is the contracts hall. Each of those boards holds various jobs that the guild has taken on. Guild members, adventuring parties and mercanaries bands can have a look and if a job looks like something they would be interested in completing they take the note to one of the desks, gets more information and signs up for it".  

You have a message for Lady Lemia? Very well" He flags down a clerk who had just finished pinning up new jobs on a nearby board and hands him his stack of jobs "Follow me" He leads you to a side door that has 2 guards standing by. "Wait here" He knocks and enters closing the door. Hard to here over the noise of the hall.

Door opens and the clerk beckonds you in. 
You see a female hafling sitting behind a large desk that has several trays full of the same job notes in them. "You have a message for me? Quickly now I'm very busy"  
"Hmm a recommendation from the High Marshal, you don't see many of those around"  
"I am the Mistress of Contracts here at the Order of the Anvil. Do you know how the contracts work?"  
"Those contracts out there" She waves towards to door "are for junior guild members who have yet to prove themselves to the guild, unaffliated adventuring groups and mercenaries"  

"They are generally not the best paids jobs but need to be done"  
"The more lucative jobs are saved for proven guild members. Now this note from the High Marshal says you have done him a good turn and he would look upon the Order favorably if we were to accept you"  
"Do you wish to join the Order?"  

"While the Marshal's note does paint you in a good light you will need take on a contract and be assessed by a qualified member before we classify you as being proved, and I have just the job and possibly you assessor"  
She shuffles through some paper "Yes here we are. There's mausoleum north of the city that needs to be cleared out of undead. The family wishes to bury a recently deceased member. You will be joined by Thorath Ironshield a cleric of Torm and a repected member of the Order."  
"I'll send word to him to me you at the Hall's enterance at dawn tomorrow."  

####Thorath Ironshield
