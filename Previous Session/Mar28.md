After the rescue of Jooves, the party split up with Mal, Eli and Little Claw accompanying the clerics and Jooves back to the temple of Torm. Mal attempted to talk to a senior cleric order to get the Lady Granrus resurrected so that she could answer some questions for him, however he was rebuffed.

The rest of the party returned to the inn they stayed in the night before. Caelom by this stage was awake and Angus filled him in on the situation. He decided that he needed to make a report to the Sages of the Arcane and so insisted they head to the Library. Caid was sent to try to indicate to the other half of the party to meet them at the Library.

They were shown into a room to see both Investigator Trent and Rasvull and was asked to give their report. Rasvull was dismissive of the report, seeing it as more lies from Caelom and while both Angus and Little Claw attempted to confirm the truthfulness of the report it wasn’t until Caelom stood up and displayed the scarring from the tortures he had gone through that Rasvull believed. Trent then insisted that Caelom returned to the University with him to report directly to Senior Investigator Ronan.

The party returned to the Springwell in where Angus asked the innkeeper if he could send a message to Lord Darrel to warn him about the possible danger he may be in. As he did this the innkeeper hands over a message that had come for the party during the last couple of days. It was a summons to report to the City Council on their part in solving the Hill Tribe troubles the next day.

During the brief down time, Mal went to see his contact in the lawyer’s office but found he had taken a leave of absence. Eli stitched together the pelts of the Dire Wolves into a cloak for Angus. After testing it was found that in its current state fire would not damage the cloak but the person under it was not so lucky.

The next day they met with the Council led by the regent of the city Lady Gallentara. After describing their actions over the last couple of weeks they got to see the High Marshal Felarn and Lord Tanafrey argue over who was responsible and what should be done. Lady Gallentara grew tired of the argument and sent the High Marshal away to escort the party out and provide an additional reward.

The High Marshal took the party to his offices where he explained he would like to be able to call upon additional resources such as the party who has no direct ties to the city but without being affiliated with the Order of the Anvil he would not be able to do so. In order to help the party gain membership more quickly he produced a letter of introduction to the Mistress of Contracts, a Lady Roseanna.

After going to the Order of the Anvil they meet with Roseanne a female Halfling who explains the way contracts work within the Order and how given the introductory letter from the High Marshal the party would be allowed to join the guild after a simple contract completion whilst being evaluated by a senior Order member. The party was asked to clean out a local Mausoleum where several servants had gone missing after being sent to prepare it for family burial. They would be joined by a cleric of Torm called Thorath Ironshield.

The next day they went to said mausoleum, with Thorath, which was about an hour north of the city. The rest of the cemetery seemed normal but as they approach the mausoleum the atmosphere changed. They noticed that the entrance door had been picked. Entering they saw a large statue (Eldath Goddess of peace) at which Thorath said a prayer and made an offering. 

As they explored this level of the mausoleum they discover little out of place until they reach the rear, where they find a crypt had been moved to reveal some stairs down. As they make this discovery a group of 4 skeletons appear. After easily handling them the party descends down where they find a dead body.

Angus sends Caid out to scout the corridors where she bumps into 4 zombies who follow her back to the party. While dealing with these zombies 2 more skeletons are drawn to the fray. After they defeat them the party explores several of the rooms where they occasionally meet some groups of skeletons.

As they make their way further in, Angus, Caid and Cig unknowingly trigger a trapped statue and while Angus and Cig manage to dive out of the way mitigating some of the damage, Caid is hit with the full force of the stone sword and is sent back to the ether. Cig then attempts to disarm the trap but fails and is hit again. Using the time before the trap resets the rest of the party rush past the trap. 

In the next room they setup for trouble and trouble they find with a mummy waiting for them. Thorath rushes to the front to do his duty in defeating undead but is hit with the mummy’s rotting fist and is visibly affect by more than just the force of the blow. Despite this he is able to cast Turn Undead forcing the mummy to flee to the back of the room where the party was able to hit it with ranged attack after ranged attack to destroy it. 

Angus urges Thorath to stay back to allow the party to show him what they are made of. As this happens 2 more skeletons attacks the party drawn by the noise of the previous fight but they are no match for the party.

The next room they encounter is a larger room with a wight and several zombies. Eli moves to the front and hits the bunched up enemies with a Hail of Thorns but this leaves her exposed in the doorway to the wight’s counter attack. His initial attempt to reach out an touch her failed but this only fueled his rage and the living and with a mighty swing of his longsword catches Eli with a great hit. 

The zombies while not doing a lot of damage manages to distract the party briefly by their unwillingness to know when they are defeated.  The wight is pushed back into the room with Angus’s Flaming Sphere. Eli once again rushes to the front avoiding a blow by a zombie in the attempt to finish off the wight but misjudges how injured it was and again is left to face its counter attack. 

Little Claw in his bear form guards Thorath who having not recovered from the encounter with the mummy was staying near the back just in time to face several more zombies who had exited the room from a second exit. Little Claw made short work of them as Thorath moved to the centre of the party to lend some healing to those that required it. Failing to avoid the rolling flaming sphere the wight screamed as it is finally comsumed by fire. Between them the party defeats the rest of the zombies.
