A carriage is waiting outside. Drive + guard in the front driving plus 2 further guards on horse back. Jooves steps out of the carraige using a cane to avoid putting weight on his injured leg. 

"Good Evening. My employer wished me to give you this" He hands Angus a letter. Nods his head re enters the carrage and they are off.

####Returning to the city
There appears to be a large gathering of people looking towards a raised platform. A wealth looking man is addressing the crowd. You catch the end of his speech. "and so I offer a reward of 10,000 gold for anyone with information that leads to the capture of my son's murderer". With that he steps down from the crowd and is surround by his personal guard.`

####Cursed Opal

As Angus carried the curse opal for more than an hour it has now attuned itself to him and so he is now cursed. He goes to the library to research it. All intelligance based rolls are at a disadvantage. He rode a dire wolf Little Claw back to the mausoleum and attempts to offer the curse opal to the statue of Eldath which seems to accept it, but on the way back to the city the opal returns to him. Heading back to the mausoleum he attempts to give all 3 back to the statue. Again it seems to accept them but on the way back the curse opal returns to him  

He then goes to the temple of Moradin and asks them for help. A senior cleric attempts to remove the curse but it appears to strong for him and he exhusts himself while trying. He suggests leaving the opal for them to study and to come back the next day. Upon exiting Little Claw donates nearly all his gold to the temple. Angus attempts to take back this donation but is stopped by the clerics and is forced to leave. A cleric explains to Little Claw that the donation while welcome is not necessary and should he wish to he may withdraw it. He refuses to do so.  

Cig and Eli attempt to find a "shaddy" inn but instead witness a gathering infront of a raised platform where a richly dressed merchant announces that he is will to reward 10,000 gp to whoever gives him information that leads to the capture of his sons murderer. Leaflets are handed out describing the situation. They see Weester on the other side of the crowd leave and they attempt to follow. They see him enter the back door of a terrenced house but when they knock on the door the woman that opens it denies any knowledge of him and they lose track of him.
