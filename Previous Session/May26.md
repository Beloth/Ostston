After Mal picked himself up the party opened the door to find unlit corridor. With no other way the people they were following could have gone they continue through. Little Claw notices several trip wires that he points out to the rest so that they can be avoided. After several turns the corridor leads to a small room with a heavy metal door at the opposite end.

The door has no visible handle or mechanism with which to open it. In fact several modifications have been made to make it difficult to be pushed open. The party spends some time trying to figure a way to open the door but without success. As they are about to give up they hear the sounds of chains rattling and the door creeps open. The party attempts to hide where they can, as a man in servants clothing backs out through the door dragging behind him a body.

Cig leapt into action grabbing the servant around the neck and placing a hand other his mouth. As the rest of the party looks into the revealed room they see another servant who backs away and heads to another exit, but before he can leave Little Claw conjures to Dire Wolves to prevent him leaving.

The party then interrogates the servant and they learn that the bodies are those of the people they were following and they had been the advisor of Lord Tanafrey before being killed. The servants had no idea what the meeting was about as they had remained outside the room before being told to get rid of the bodies. They also explain that this used to be a escape route from the palace which could be accessed from the cellars.

The party decides that the servants have no more information and leave them to continue to do their jobs and they retreat back through the corridor and out into the palace grounds. After a brief discussion most head back to Springwell Inn while Angus heads to the Library with the intent of sending a message back to his mentor. Whilst there he commissions a scroll of catapult as well as a steel spike to be launched from the spell.

Eli and Little Claw head to the Order of the Anvil with Little Claw carrying Eli on his shoulders. Once there they head to the practice area where Eli tries to shoot at the targets while on a stationary Little Claw. They then attempting to to do the same with Little Claw running. Unfortunately this ends in Eli nearly shooting the Order's Master at Arms, Foligu. They leave rather quickly.

Back at Springwell Inn, the party rests and are surprised to receive another round of free drinks. They find this suspicious and they try to investigate who and why they are being sent these drinks. They attempt to talk to several of the other guests in the inn but find no more information about who is sending them these drinks. Both Mal and Angus decide to take the drinks anyway and they decide to turn in for the night.

Cig wakes in the middle of the night to the noise of the window shutter in his and Eli's room being opened. He attempts to quickly wake Eli up but is interrupted by 2 cloaked figures who immediately attack him bring him close to death. With that Cig attempts to flee the room and despite Eli waking up they ignore her to chase after Cig. After knocking Cig unconscious they throw him out the window to several others. The rest of the party have woken up by this time and move to intercept, however both Mal and Angus are affected by something that was probably in the drinks they had.

Once outside Cig's kidnappers are confronted by Little Claw's 2 conjured Dire Wolves as will him in Dire Wolf from. They use some item to cause everyone around them to disappear. The wolves using their keen senses make an attempt on the kidnappers but they manage to evade and move away. The last kidnapper is finally subdued by Mal's sleep spell while the other seemingly escapes.
