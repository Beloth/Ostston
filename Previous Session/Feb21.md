#Next Session

###Last Session
They found the teleportation circle. Fell for the gem trap and ambushed by the Hell wolves. On the way to Hallard Fort they were herded by some more Hell Wolves and stumbled into a clearing where 2 owlbears were being attack by Hell Wolves. They attacked and defeated both groups.

###This Session
####Initial description
Just defeated the Owl Bears and Hell Wolf combination.

Heading towards the edge of the forest. The sense of dread eases. Perception check DC 12+ Hell wolves appear to have turned back.

####On the way to Ostston
In the hilly area it appears a band of Orcs have started to build a camp. Stealth check of 12+ to get closer. Around 30+ Orcs there. They seem to be fortifing the camp. Maybe used the conflict to get passed the patrols and set this up. Sneak around the camp and try to avoid the roving bands. Group Stealth check of 14+ to stop from being detected. Choice of that the wide path around north or south. Add many days to the journey or sneak through some of the valleys. Stealth roll of 14+ if successful perception check of 12+ to spot the roving band in one of the valley. If successful can ambush the orcs. 

If they defeat the orcs without 1 escaping the are free to move on. Otherwise chased by another band of orcs.

####River bank
Make to the river bank. See what appears to be a ruined tower to the North. Several days travel.
Survivability check 14+ to mfind a safe crossing point. Perception check of 13+ with disadvantage. They are being stalked by a Displacer beast. 

Perception check failed beast ambushes them as they try to cross. If passed see the beast.

Survivability passed

Athletics 10+ to cross - you found a suitable ford to cross at. Relatively shallow maybe up to a foot of water.

* if failed fall into the river but as the crossing you found was relatively shallow all that happens is you get soaked through. Need to camp and dry off and get warm again
* if successful you cross successfully

Survivability failed

Athletics 15+ to cross - the best place you have found to cross is still quite dangerous. Quite fast flowing water 2-3 feet of water. 

* if failed you are pulled off you feet. Dex check to see if you grab onto something or someone. Strength check to see if you ware pulled up. if failed you are sweeped away by the current. Athletics roll of 14+ until successful. Number of failed rolls determines how far down you are sweeped.
* if sucessful you safely make it across the river
