#Session 28 - 11th November 2016

* Angus disguised himself as one of the cultists and using Caid as a scout followed a group of slaves to a room with a portal. Sneaking inside he finds 4 altars with sacrifices on them including Uncle Eldorin. The slaves are being walked through the portal
* Angus lures one of the cults out of the room where the group ambushes and kills him.
* They entered the room and kills the rest of the defending cultists and devils.
* The sacrifices all have their chests opened with a crystal embedded next to their hearts, pulsing in time with their heartbeats
* Uncle Eldorin apologies to Eli for falling under the mages spell and tells her that he saw several of their tribe with the slaves taken through the portal. Any healing spell used for the sacrifices heals them briefly before the crystals reassert themselves causing emense pain to them.
* He says he has just enough stregth to keep the portal open for them as one by one the other sacrifices die. Before Eli leaves he reaches up to bring her head closer and kisses her forehead
* The party jump through the portal but unlike others where it seemed instantaneous this one they experiances the travel and near the end they seem to "bounce" out something and emerge through an unstable opening.
* They find themselves in an enormous cavern with a large temple like building in the distance.
* After a rest they head towards the temple using Angus's horse and disc to speed them up, but an umber hulk tries to ambush them. After defeating it they realise theu left they left Tharlin at their camp. 
* some of the party rushes back to try to find him but instead they find  signs of a battle and after following a trail they find his remains.

####Outside the ritual room

* Several bodies of cultists laying around. Looks like Tharlin was ambushed after the slab came down but he dealt with them. 
* One appears to be still alive but barely.
* Passive perception 15+ make a perception check DC20.
  * You see a the walls closest to the room take on a faint glow.
  * Investigation check dc15+ You see runes starting to appear on the walls.
* Timer starts 30 mins


#####What the alive cultist knows

* Chuckles 
* Ritual hear to power the portal to the temple. Just needed one more boost which the party was going to give
* Portal room at the top of the tower.
* Opening the portal will drain the life force of everyone in the tower that is not in the portal room
* Some of slaves in the tower will be sent through the portal to the temple other will die to empower the tower.
* Cultist after a time will kill himself. Passive perception 15+ make a perception check DC15.
  * Success notice that the cultist is moving his hand and can shout a warning
  * The cultist swings his arm. If warned the person in front has a reaction
  * Cultist shouts "In the master's name" and jams a hidden blade into his own throat
  
####Journey to the Portal Room

* All the walls are starting to glow. The runes are becoming more noticable.
* Passive Perception DC10+ hear the sounds of steps in unison.
* If follow see the end of a column of the slaves marching up the stairs followed by a couple of the cultists.


####Portal Room

4 Altars with bodies on them. Their chests have been opened up and glowing crystals are next to their beating hearts. Eli and anyone with passive perception of 15+ notices that one of the bodies is Uncle Eldorin

Encounter 

2 Cultist, 2 * 150 = 300  
4 imps, 4 * 100 = 400  
1 Bearded Devil, 1 * 700 = 700  

Total = 1,400xp  

As the encounter ends the crystal's glow is dying out and the portal is flickering and reducing in size. Eldorin is looking at Eli and trying to reach out with his hand.

#####Uncle Eldorin

* "I'm so sorry little one." You see blood dribbling from his mouth.
* Any healing spell cast on his causing him to cry out in agony. You see the wounds try to heal but after a second they re-open and the crystal momentarily brighten.
* "I thought I could protect myself but she was too strong."
* "Its too late fore me but I saw several of your cousins go though the portal. They will be used in whatever ritual she has planned on the other side. You must rescue them"
* "I can hold on long enough for you to go though the portal".
* He reaches up and pushes a stray hair and tucks it over your ear and you are reminded of all the times he had done that in your childhood.
* "Be strong... I will always be with you." He pulls your head down and places a bloodied kiss upon your forehead. 
  * Perception check dc12+ As he pulls back you see his eyes glow briefly.
* "Now go!" He lays back on the stone altar and screws his face in concentration and the crystal begins to glow brighter and the portal aperture grows. 
* As you approach the portal he screams in rage and the portal opens wide enough to travel though.
* You spare a brief look back you see him looking at you and smile through the pain. Just as you walk backwards though the portal you see his eyes glaze over as his body begin to disintergrate and turn into ash and the portal begins to shrink again

####The portal travel.

* the first few through
  * You've travelled via portal before and that was instantaneously but this one is different you feel like you are travelling fast though a long tunnel (imagine stargate travel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcyA1kp_1sA). You see an opening which you assume is the exit but instead on passing through you actuall bounce off and vector off through another shorter tunnel and thrown out.
    * Arobatics or Dex save DC15+ 
      * Failed 1D6 damage as you fall 10ft from the opening and fail to long properly
      * Success half damage
    * When you land you see the portal exit flicker and move to the ground 15ft away  
* Last 3 are thrown out of the portal 
  * You've travelled via portal before and that was instantaneously but this one is different you feel like you are travelling fast though a long tunnel (imagine stargate travel). You feel as sharp turn and you are thrown out  
    * Arobatics or Dex save DC10+ 
      * Failed 1D4 damage as you fall 10ft from the opening and fail to long properly
      * Success no damage.
* Arcana check DC15+ You remember that the temple was protected and only the leader of the mages could break through to travel there. Obviously she had come up with a way to get the portal through the protection but with only Eldorin's life force powering it it must of not been enough and the portal exited as close as possible. In fact you're kind of amazed that that actually happened... thinking about it, its was more likely that you would have gone splat against the protection or been lost in the void...

####Temple Cavern
* Huge cavern. Damp, you can hear the sound of dripping. Large stalagmites and stalagtites would dominate you view if it wasn't for the gigantic building in the distance.
* Stone building with several towers. There's an odd green glow eminating from the stones work.
* Pools of brackish water.
* Maybe an hours travel from the enterance of the temple.

#####Travel to the temple.

* Easy encounter

####Temple Enterance

####Eli's dream during the next long rest

Your dreams are disturbed by visions of Blackpine Forest. You see several trails through the forest that you recognise but many more that you don't. Of long walks trough the forest where you learn of its secrets. You see yourself approching several different beast calmly reaching out to pet, to talk, to embace them. You feel the power of nature course through you as you sit in a peaceful glen.
