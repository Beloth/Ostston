#Session 28 - 11th November 2016

* Angus disguised himself as one of the cultists and using Caid as a scout followed a group of slaves to a room with a portal. Sneaking inside he finds 4 altars with sacrifices on them including Uncle Eldorin. The slaves are being walked through the portal
* Angus lures one of the cults out of the room where the group ambushes and kills him.
* They entered the room and kills the rest of the defending cultists and devils.
* The sacrifices all have their chests opened with a crystal embedded next to their hearts, pulsing in time with their heartbeats
* Uncle Eldorin apologies to Eli for falling under the mages spell and tells her that he saw several of their tribe with the slaves taken through the portal. Any healing spell used for the sacrifices heals them briefly before the crystals reassert themselves causing emense pain to them.
* He says he has just enough stregth to keep the portal open for them as one by one the other sacrifices die. Before Eli leaves he reaches up to bring her head closer and kisses her forehead
* The party jump through the portal but unlike others where it seemed instantaneous this one they experiances the travel and near the end they seem to "bounce" out something and emerge through an unstable opening.
* They find themselves in an enormous cavern with a large temple like building in the distance.
* After a rest they head towards the temple using Angus's horse and disc to speed them up, but an umber hulk tries to ambush them. After defeating it they realise theu left they left Tharlin at their camp. 
* some of the party rushes back to try to find him but instead they find  signs of a battle and after following a trail they find his remains.
