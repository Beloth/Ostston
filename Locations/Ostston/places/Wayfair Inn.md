- Tribesman raid on Wayfair inn  
	An old farmstead built before the main road between the towns Ostston and Highcastle was made as is about 2 days ride from Ostston. The increase in trade between the 2 cause a stone layed road to be put down. The greater number of travellers attracted the attention of many a bandit and highwaymen. That along with the constant threat of the Hill Tribes to the East caused the local Lord to build the garrsion fort of Highcastle about 2 days travel to the south. The great grandfather (Old Ted) of the current owner (Young Ned) saw the increase in traffic as a way of making some extra gold. He converted the attached barn into a Inn/tavern so that the merchant and their guards had somewhere to rest.  
	
	Building have a stone base with a wooden frame and thatched roof. Stables between the inn and the farmhouse. Low fence out front with a gate more to keep the cows of the farm wandering in than any sort of defensive measure.
