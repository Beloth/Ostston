#Next Session - 30th June

###Last Session

The party Enacted their plan to infiltrate the camp. They watched as the Packmaster went on patrol then sneaked into the hut that seemed to contain the leader of the camp. There they found a Tiefling who Mal attempted to convince that he was there for a report on the camp. This deception failed and the rest of the party launched into action. After a brief fight they subduded the Tiefling and held of the horde of controlled civilians while Angus worked out how the control belt worked. He managed to give them a command to stop attacking. The party then woke the Tiefling up and casting Detect Thoughts by Mal and Suggestion by Angus the party questions her. They learn many things amoung which is she is Mal's half sister (Pelarna) and that he has many other siblings , some of which (Melanor, male fighter and Pelgora, female fighter) are working, like her, with the master who is against their mutual father.

####Dwarven trade caravan - Difficulty - medium
As the group travels through the forest passive perception 15+ Something catches your attention, you motion for the rest of the group to stop and be quite, make a perception check.

Perception check: 
                 Nat20 you hear a deep male voice shouting out a battle cry to the North West   
                 20+ Shouting coming from maybe 500m the North West and the sounds of battle  
                 15+ Shouting coming from the North West and the sounds of battle  
                 10+ You briefly thought you heard so shouts but it was so short you weren't able to pinpoint a direction  
                 5+ Was probably nothing.  
                 

As you head towards the shouts and sounds of battle you stumble across the a visablly injured Hell Wolves standing over a body. A quick look around reveals the rapidly disolving body of another wolf.

####Dead body

Male Dwarf.

Investigation check

Nat 20. Relatively young Dwarf with red hair and a plaited beard. From the tracks it did not seem like he was retreating from the battle but delibarately leading the wolves away. The numerous wounds on his body indicates that the 2 wolves you see here are unlikely the only ones he fought. Likely to have found 4+ wolves and a closer look reveals what appears to be wounds from a whip.

####Clearing

You arrive just a visibly injured Dwarf raises his Warhammer above his head and with a battle cry smashes down on the head of the packmaster at his feet, pulping its head. As the devil dissolves the dwarf stumbles and falls to his knee. Using the warhammer as a crutch barely catches himself from face planting.

The clearing is strewn with the bodies of several other dwarves as well several mules/donkeys.

As the dwarf hears you approach he glances up and glares at you. With a grunt of pain he forces himself to his feet, hefts his warhammer and sets his shield. He stares at Mal..  

"More of you devil bastards! Come on then! There's still 1 dwarf that draws breath here!" 

Persuasion check DC 14 if Not Mal, DC 20 if Mal  

If failed the Dwarf charges Mal
If success

The dwarf sinks to his knees again dropping his shield. and clutching his side. Passive perception 10+ sees the blood spreading from beneath his hand.

"No... no time... you must find Jarnol. He headed south west hoping to get out of this acursed forrest. He took the heartstone to keep it from these devils." 

He starts coughing up blood. You realise what it must have cost him to rise to his feet and he's paying for his defiance now.  

"Get after them.. they must'nt get the heartstone". He points towards the forest to the south west.

1 dwarf trying to hold off a pack master and 2 wolves. He kills one of the wolves but takes a bad wound from the pack master

Another dwarf has just finished kill 1 wolf and battling another. He is clutching a sack in one hand

As the party engages perception check. DC 15+ You see a flicker behind the dwarf and a tiefling appears and the dwarf's eyes widen in surprise, his mouth goes slack and the sack falls from his hands. The tiefling grabs the bag and flickers out.





#####Reason for the dwarven trade caravan

They were approached my a member of Sages of the Arcane. They were going to be building a hall at the University and wanted the dwarves to craft them a heartstone to a certain specification. It was suggested the we head though the forrest to avoid Ostston duties.

Arcane check

Nat 20: A heartstone is a powerful magical artifact. It acts as the centre or heart of a warding scheme. The more complex a warding scheme the bigger the heart needs to be. There are several flavours of heartstone, for example dwarven made ones tend to complement a rigid scheme, one achored in stone or earth. Elven made ones are more flexible and better in natural, living enviroments. Powering a heartstone takes time as it generally absorbs some of the surrounding magical energy and slowly gains strength however it is possible to push power in to it but this should be done with great care as if too much power is pushed too quickly there can be unforseen consequences

####Evening

If killed Pelarna in cold blood or killed any innocent people  

#####Mal's nightmare

You are floating infront of the same tower, the 4 eyed visage above. You suddenly curl up in agony as something is pulled from you. Through the pain you see the images of those innocent people you killed are torn from you and are sent towards the tower. You see them trying to escape the pull of the tower, crying, begging to be freed but you can do nothing as they are consumed by the image above the tower. Finally Pelarna's image is drawn from you. Unlike the others her struggle seems partially successful. Her movement towards the tower is slower and you can see the strain on her face. Finally she tears free and heads upwards with a trumphant smirk on her face, which fades as her journey upwards is halted and another force jerks her back down but instead of heading towards the tower she is pulled in another direction. As you focus on the direction she is traveling you can faintly see what appears to be the top of another tower in the far distance 

If killed by other members of the party you see the images of those dead float past you into the tower.

Mal wakes from the nightmare. Wings have grown to a 2 foot wing span. Disadvantage to any Dex based rolls as you are unuse to them. They throw off you're centre of balance. 1 week.

2 Hells wolves attack - 900xp  

####Roland Zola
After defeating the wolves.  
He slumps to the ground, breathing heavily, obviously exhausted. He looks up to you.  
"Thank you, I can't thank you enough." He takes a deep breath "That should give me time to get away. You should leave too. If you're this deep in they'll kill you 1st and ask questions later"  
With that he tiredly clambers to his feet.

If questioned  
"Look.. I thank you for defeating them but I can tarry here. The longer I wait the more chance more will find my trail. They don't take lightly to people leaving."  

"I'm just an lowly appentice mage looking for a subject for my Duoklau dissitation (Angus - one of the many things a mages need to do to become a full fledged member of the Sages of the Arcane although he appears old to still be on his Duoklau, its one of the 1st steps)  

Insight check  

Nat 20 -  Obviously lying, you can see his eyes darting side to side and more beads of sweat appearing on his brow. He is also clutching what you believe to be his focus. He's obviously an appentice mage but the Duolane was not the reason he was here.

Persuasion DC 13+ or Intimidation DC 10+  

"Look I know this doesn't look good but I can explain..... I was sent here to investigate what was going on. I'm the apprentice to Investigator Rensure. I need to get back to him to explain my findings. I'm sure if you let me go you'll be rewarded"

Insight check DC

20+ He's still lying to you. You get the feeling this is how he operates and probably why he's still an apprentice
15+ He's lying to you still
10+ Not totally being truthful.

Persuasion DC 13+ or Intimidation DC 10+  
"Ok.. ok... look. I am an apprentice in the Sage's of the Arcane, or maybe that should be I was an apprentice. But it was clear they didn't understand me... I mean look at me, 24 and still trying to pass my Duoklau. Most who joined with me are already on their Decklau or have already been made members.  After they rejected my 3rd attempt at Duoklau I was approached by Yandlar. She said she had seen what was being done with me and that those old windbags were purposely holding me back, that it had been done to others as well in order for them to retain their standing in the guild. That change was needed and that a movement had begun and that I could become a leading figure. It started small at first, just passing on gossip about fellow appentices, those who might struggle under the same restrictions that I did, those who might be aminable to change.

I thought nothing about it at first. I mean there are several movements going on at the University at all times. Its almost expected that you belong to a movement."

He leans in closer and whispers

"I mean, its rumoured that the leader of the movement was Ameria Mandel herself. I mean if the daughter of the headmistress was leading it, it can't be bad right?"

Back to his normal voice

"but I doubt that's true. I mean they lied about everything else. They finally got me back into the field and out of those boring lectures (he looks pointed at Angus at that point), but then the requests became more and more arduous, until I end up here.. in a cursed forrest, dealing with devil dogs and fanatical cultists worshiping some stone. I decided that this was not for me and waited for an oppertunity to leave"

He looks disgusted with himself.

"I should have known better..." He sighs "Look if I tell you everything I know will you let me go and not turn me in to the Sages? I'll head back and continue my studies and not cause any more trouble"

If the party agrees

"Ok.. we best move on though and find somewhere safe to hole up... more may be on my trail"

####What Roland knows

* Several groups working together. The break away mages, members taken from those who are unhappy with the Sages leadership. There is a cult group worshipping an Archdevil. A smaller group who seem to be mainly made up of Tieflings. The cultists and the devils seem to defer to the Teiflings but the mages leadership often clash with the Tieflings on what to do
* The mages are trying to access a temple that is rumoured to be under the lake. 
* The Cultist are intent on delivering souls to their devil masters
* Who knows what the Tieflings are trying to do.
* They are setting up orbs of power in 4 (NW, NE, SE, SW) locations around the lake. Once powered up they will opend a portal to the temple.
* They have built forts around the orbs, all but 1 is completed and are stockpiling material to repair the temple.
* Rumors are that the temple is not the end game. The temple will lead to another pocket dimension which the Archdevil wants to take over. That is the price he wants in order to grant the mages what they want. 
* Close to completing the final orb and fort but will take time to power up. The orb is vulnerable while not powered, its very fragile at that stage but it's probably well defended. 


###Temple

Crystal similiar to the one the party destoryed in the 1st clearing. Cultist surrounding it chanting. It flicks in time with the stone portal.


####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
