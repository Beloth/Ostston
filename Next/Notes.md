####Cig's capture

Tracking Cig's kidnappers

Survivability check

#####10+ takes about 15mins to find their trail  
The party finds Cig unconcious along with 3 bodies of the kidnappers. Around them are 3 people dressed in dark clothing, hoods up with with only theirs eys visable above the cloth covering the rest of their faces. 1 in kneeling is front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

#####15+ takes about 5-10 mins to find the trail  
The party finds Cig unconcious with 2 of the kidnappers dead and the last one being double teamed.  1 in kneeling is front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

#####20+ finds the trail quickly  
The party finds Cig unconcious with 1 dead assassin and 2 others being confronted by 3 cloaked people. After combat ends 1 kneels in front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

"Stand down" the kneeling woman says as you approach, "their his friends". They sheath their weapons but maintain their defesive positions. Cig comes to conciousness when the woman waves something under his nose. After a moment she helps Cig to his feet.

Once Cig is able to stand by himself she removes her hood and pulls down the cloth covering her mouth. You recognise her as the woman (Katrine) that you met you showed you to the meeting place for the thieves guild (and the tunnels).

Cig roll a perception check 10+ the other 2 are familiar to you, 15+ you recognise the other 2 as the ones that had followed you when you were looking for those scouts way back when

"You should have been more wary. Your description has been sent out to all and there has been talk of a hefty bounty for your capture."

The 2 shadows start moving the bodies of the kidnappers while Katrine leads you down a side alley where she pushes some crates to the side reveling a celler door. She opens in and leads you down some stairs to a small room where once you are in she closes the door and rotates a small wheel. She lights a small latern. 

The room is plain, has a simple table and a couple of chairs as well as a sleeping mat in 1 corner. 

"I don't have much time but I can answer a couple of you questions" looking at Cig.

* Her benefactor wants to know who ordered Borivik's death but they can't be seen to be actively looking in this area.
* She has been told to aid you were possible without blowing her cover
* She doesn't think that the Ostston Guildmaster is involved
* The leaders of the various districts are scambling for power at the moment especially with the death of the the Slum Lord.
* The Old Tinkerer ordered your capture motivations unknown. 
* Suggests to stay out of the Sewers for now. Not safe there for Cig and might not be safe for the rest of the Hand considering the Old Tinkerer knows of you now.


####Arcahnist Shaniera
We meets you at the Springwell Inn. "Good morning. If I could have a moment of your time. I have arranged for a private room"

"The Marshal has asked me to brief you on the portal and the research that I have done."

"It appears that you were correct. It is a portal to the Blackpine Forrest. As I did not know much about the area I asked Belorn (the Steward) for whatever information the area that was avaliable. What I found was... interesting... Ostston apparently has a treaty in place, a very old treaty dating back to before Hestal was formed, infact before Ostston was a true city state. The treaty states that in return for help Lord Ost renouces all claims to the forest. A clause in the treaty also states that no agent of Ost may enter the forest without incurring a penalty. Next to this clause was a hand written note by Lord Ost himself claiming that the penalty was great and that none should risk it. 

In addition there was a clause that should they need more help Ost would to provide a harvest and help would be given."

Belorn also told me that the scroll the treaty is written on is one of the items that every Lord of Ostston must swear upon when they take up the mantle. This swearing invokes some sort of magic but I have not yet managed to determine what it does."

"This brings us to you. You have sworn no oaths to Ostston and so are not an agent of Ostston" She stands up straighter more formal "As a representative of the Sages of the Arcane I request that you investigate the other side of the portal. Find out what is happening and why this portal has been setup".

####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
