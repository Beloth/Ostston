#Next Session

###Last Session
They sent a message to Hillard Tower via a bird that they failed to return the villages but found the portal and mage. Attempted to head to Ostston but found that there was an orc camp to the west blocking their way. Attempted to go round but was found by a patrol which they defeated but one escaped to raise the alarm. They avoided the rest and headed instead to the Wayfair inn. There the drunk themselves into a stuper on free ale. They informed the local Sargent of the orc camp who sent a patrol to scout it out

They then reached Ostston and rented rooms in Spring Well Inn. Little Claw and Eli went to Winyfred's Wonderous Wares where Little Claw looked into sending a message (6gp)
The rest went to the Palace and talked to the duty officer then to the High Marshal about the situation. Got the gold for the 3 present then Angus used magic to pretend to be a young male Eli and got that share.

###This Session
####Initial description
Meeting back at the Inn?

####In Ostston
Time to shop and explore

####Summons to the council
A few days later they recieve a summons to the council to explain the situation.
They are escorted through the busy hallways by 2 guards. Lots of people wlking though the hallways, servants, guards and others. You are lead into what appears to be a throne room where there appears to be a queue to one of the side doors on the other side to which you are being lead

Perception check (DC18+)
You notice a figure hiding in the shadows that appears to be watching you

you enter what seems to be a waiting room where 2 guards stand by the door. A clerk sits at a desk and motions to some seats. Please take a seat the council will see you soon

Perception check

* 10+ you hear raised voices but can't really make out what is being said
* 15+ their is an obvious disagreement within the council. Several are disbelieving
* 20+ Male voice seems to be the most veriment in his disbelieve and calls into question the envidence

####Council Room
Well appointed room with high ceilings and a large glass window letting in a lot of light. Large rectangle table dominated the room arround which sits the council. At the head is Lady Gellantara, Lord Tanafrey, Steward Belorn and Archanist Shaniera on her right and Priestess Val'oren, High Merchant Xavier and High Marshal Felarn on her left.

High Marshal Felarn stands and introduces you to them. Lady Gellantara and councillors this is the party who brought news of Hillards fall and the portal to which our subjects were taken through.

"Hmm they don't look like much." The figure sitting at the right hand of Lady Gallentara (Lord Tanafrey)
"Their tale matches with the reports I'm getting" replies Felarn
"Reports that are obviously too late for us to do anything about" retorts Tanafrey
"And the Marshal of Highcastle will pay for his incompetancy. You was it that pushed for his promotion in the 1st place!"
"Why you..." Tanafrey looks to stand
"Enough!" shouts Lady G "Enough this arguing will get us no where"
"Agreed" the female half elf. "perhaps questioning this party would be a better use of our time than rehashing old arguments"
She turns to you "tell me of this portal and the one who held it open"

Lady G
"Thank you for your time... you will receive a bonus.. High Marshal Felarn please take care of it and show them out" A clear dismissal of Felarn. Tanafrey looks smug

Felarn walks you out and takes a pouch from the clerks desk. "Follow me." He takes you to what is obviously his office. Gives you the pouch (holds a further 500gp)
"I had hoped the council will allow me to boost the number of guards due to your testimony but Tanafrey obviously has the ear of Lady G at the moment and has blocked that. I can't afford to go directly against him at this time." "If you are interested I may have jobs for you in the future, but I will need to wait a while otherwise it would be too obvious. That is if you are interested?"

"In the mean time if you are looking for work you could head to the Order of the Anvil. I'll write you an introductory note which will get you a meeting with Roszana who is incharge of the handing out the contracts.

####Exploring the Merchant Quarter
If the prosperity of a city can be determine by the amount and varity of the goods sold by it merchants that by all accounts Ostston is a very prosperous place. There are merchants here selling everything from spices to furniture to magic items.

Perceptions check 
* 10+ the is a subtle undercurrent of worry
* 15+ Though there still appears to be many things on sale there does seem to be a number of empty shelves

After a time exploring

Angus make a perception check

* 10+ You think you saw somthing important but you don't know what or why
* 15+ You saw something in one of the shop windows that bugs you. Thinking back and using your keen mind you recall the shop selling wooden items, chairs, tables, musical insturments, wait, there it is, the whistle, exactly the same style as Eli's.


####Winyfred's Wonderous Wares

[Winyfred's Goods](https://github.com/Beloth/Ostston/blob/master/Locations/Ostston/places/Winyfred's%20Wonderous%20Wares.md) 

#####If Angus tries to get a mage guild discount
Winyfred wants to see his guild identification. "Guild identification please". As he has none the shop keeper sighs at him. "Oh dear. 1st time outside the University without your sponsor is it? No.. hmm strange your sponsor should ahve gotten you guild identification. You'll need identification before I can give you any discount"

If Angus says you never needed it before. "Where have you been shopping? At a non-guild approved shop. Here in Ostston?"

"Hmm Highcastle was it.. well not my problem. But it'll be wise of you to report them but thats your call"

"Now for identification.. I can help you there for a small fee" Pointing to a display cabinat filled with various rings, amulets and trinkets "Just select one of these to be the basis of your identification then I'll talk to the Magistar to get your membership details"

After choosing the item she picks up a small hand mirror from beneath the desk. With a small arcane gesture he calls out "Magistar of registration office" "This is Winyfred's Wonderous Wares" and he holds up an amulet, which glows briefly, to the mirror. A voice comes from the mirror "How may I help Miss Winyfred" "well it appears I have a Wizard here without the proper identification". She twists the mirror round so that its facing Angus

Old Female gnome. Grey hair tied in a bun. Half moon spectacles. The mirror appears to be sitting on the desk that she is sitting behind. Several crystals in holders on the edge of the desk. She picks a clear one up and holds it infront of the mirror. "Name" After giving his name: There is a bright flash from the crystal that momentarily blinds Angus and anyone else in from of the mirror. When his sight returns the crystal is back in the holder and a large opne book has appeared infront of the gnome and the pages are flickering rapidly and the stops. The gnome starts reading.

"Angus deSchwarz MAcDonnach hmmm" "age 30" "Sponsor Robert Caelom" "Junior Lecturer on 'The magical embodiment in ancient architecture ... ' " ends in a mumble "hmm that's strange there's a sealed note on your file 1 second please" The mirror goes dark as some music is heard coming from the mirror.

See if party does anything

There is a bell ring from the back of the shop After a time the gnome reappears "Right well I've sent the identification cystal to Winyfred's however Junior Lecturer MacDonnach you to return to the University." With that she hands off the mirror to a middle aged male human. "This senior investigator Ronon. There are issues with the investigation into the necromancer. You are to return to answer questions. You have 2 days. I will inform The Ostston Library to expect you" With that the connection closes down

####Order of the Anvil

As you approch it is less of a guild hall and more of a massive stone fortification 3 stories high. 2 heavily armed guards stand at the side of the thick open wooden doors. You can see several guards standing on the roof looking down.

You enter a large central hall which is busy with people. Several desks are at the sides manned by clerks with queues of people waiting to talk to them. Many large notice boards are scattered around the hall with what appears to be little notes pinned to them.
