#Next Session No 29 

###Last Session 28 - Nov 11th

* Angus disguised himself as one of the cultists and using Caid as a scout followed a group of slaves to a room with a portal. Sneaking inside he finds 4 altars with sacrifices on them including Uncle Eldorin. The slaves are being walked through the portal
* Angus lures one of the cults out of the room where the group ambushes and kills him.
* They entered the room and kills the rest of the defending cultists and devils.
* The sacrifices all have their chests opened with a crystal embedded next to their hearts, pulsing in time with their heartbeats
* Uncle Eldorin apologies to Eli for falling under the mages spell and tells her that he saw several of their tribe with the slaves taken through the portal. Any healing spell used for the sacrifices heals them briefly before the crystals reassert themselves causing emense pain to them.
* He says he has just enough stregth to keep the portal open for them as one by one the other sacrifices die. Before Eli leaves he reaches up to bring her head closer and kisses her forehead
* The party jump through the portal but unlike others where it seemed instantaneous this one they experiances the travel and near the end they seem to "bounce" out something and emerge through an unstable opening.
* They find themselves in an enormous cavern with a large temple like building in the distance.
* After a rest they head towards the temple using Angus's horse and disc to speed them up, but an umber hulk tries to ambush them. After defeating it they realise theu left they left Tharlin at their camp. 
* some of the party rushes back to try to find him but instead they find signs of a battle and after following a trail they find his remains.

####Travelling to the temple.

#####Settlement
* Passive perception of 10+ to notice tracks. Survivability check 15+ to follow track
  * If successful takes 30 minutes
  * If failed they stumble around for a couple of hours before finding the settlement
* They find an abandoned settlement. Judging from the state of the building must have been abandoned a long time ago. 
* Total of 15+ buildings. Smallest seem to be dwellings and a couple of the larger ones seem to be communial. 
* Survivalibity check DC14+
  * Successful check - find what appears to be a small moss farm.
* Investigation check of the site
  * 10+ find a opening leading to a cellar which is full of mushrooms (farm?)
  * 12+ Water storage system?
  * 14+ Grave site - maybe 40+ graves - religous check DC10+ markings to Mielikki goddess of the forest
* Investigation of the main building. 
  * main room contains a small altar with a silver statue of a unicorn with a goldern horn and small saphaires for eyes. Religion check DC10+ Statue to Mielikki (my-LEE-kee) - the goddess of autumn, druids, dryads, forests, forest creatures, and rangers. Her symbol is a gold-horned, blue-eyed unicorn's head facing left
  * A study in the main building. Ornate desk. Remains of a skeleton sitting at the desk. Perception 10+ there is a dagger just under the desk. Several journals on a shelf plus one on the desk.

#####Journal on desk
* Last entry - May the Goddess forgive me. I cannot go on...
* I've have just buried Hiron. My the Goddess take him home. I am the last one left. 
* Ethal and Peri have passed away. They survived the sickness but were not strong enough to recover. The moss and mushrooms are not enough.
* The sickness has spread. Nearly 3/4 of us have caught it. What little medcine we had has run out.
* Nerion has come down with something. He has a high fever. I'm not sure what we can do.

#####Journal on shelf
* A few more have made it from the temple to us. That makes 54.
* Our prayers remain unanswered. Have we truely fallen so far that She has turned her back on us.
* Stoklin lead an party back to the temple. She managed to get much needed supplies but lost 2 people. I am not sureit was worth it
* Stoklin ventured back to the temple. She reports that the devils have now left and it is safe for use to return. The only thing she has seen is a few harmless ghosts
* We have return. Going back to the temple was a mistake. The presense of the ghost has become stronger. More and more appear and while they do not attack they are a constain reminder of what we have lost. It has driven several to take their own lives. 

####The Temple

#####The walkway
* Ghost running away from the temple. When they reach a certain distance from the temple door they fade from view. Several fall before reaching that point.

#####Inside
* Several statues and images of various animals - especially unicorns. Trees also play an important part.
* Damaged tapestries adorn the walls. All indicates the wealth of the temple.
* As you enter you see more of these ghosts
* More ghost running away. 
* You see several ghost battling air. The silence is only broken by the movement of the party. The chilled air adds to the disconserting atmosphere.
* Religion check 
  * DC10+ temple to Mielikki (my-LEE-kee). You can see various icons to her. 
  * DC15+ The ornate nature of the temple is at odds with what you know of Mielikki. Her followers tend to worship in a more natural setting.
* As you go deeper into the temple the temparture drops. You The number of battling ghosts increases and you see several take what appears to be mortal wounds and the ghost disappears.
  * If the party waits they will see the same ghost appear and restart their final fight.
* Passive perception 15+ 
  * You hear low mutterings coming from the ahead of you.
  * You see a robed female ghostly form walking in front of you. She seems to be trying to comfort the battling ghosts. Moving from ghostly battle to ghostly battle. Closer look she is a woof elf dressed in ornate robes
  * Perception check vs stealth. If she hears the party she turns towards them. Her eyes widden as she takes in your living status. You can see that is has been crying and the when the tears drip from her face they disappear into the ether. She moves towards you.. "You must leave.. you are not safe here.." 
    * If the party took the statue from the ruins, she tilts her head and turns to the person holding it. "You are not one of hers yet you hold her symbol... the symbol that was taken from here to continue her worship..." The tears stop and you notice her eyes start to gleam... "That does not belong to you"
      * Need to pursuade her not to attack. If successful she leads you to her office
      * If failed she attacks. Before she dies she will flee to her office
  

#####Office of Floryn Fernwood

* Name is Floryn Fernwood. Head cleric to Mielikki. 
  * I was the head cleric here when the fall came.
* We were too prideful... to sure in our favour with her and that was our downfall. We felt that we were uncorruptable
* We were infiltrated by a cult. A cult of devil worshippers called the Cult of Malchar. They started out in the village outside the temple but slowly they made their way in.
* Their target was the Orb of Mielikki in the basement of the temple and the source of our power. With that they ripped the temple out and cast it to this plane. 
* Caused the village to be moved to another plane. One that would be untracable to others.

####Prisoner 
* Archanist Shaniera
