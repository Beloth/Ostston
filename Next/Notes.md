#Next Session

###Last Session

  While resting the party hear multiple foot steps passing by the barricaded door by they remained undistrubed. Once up they continued to explore and Ciad finds another shut door. Angus decided to open it and is confronted by some sort of fiend. Believing the saying that that discretion is the better part of valour, Angus retreats to the rest of the party you then setup for an ambush. However as nothing confronts them they slowly move back towards the door alert for anything that would attack them. Eli, suprised by a sudden movement loses several arrows at a rat that darts down the corridor. When they hit it the rat revert back to its fiend form before dissolving into nothing. The party head back to the door only to find it closed again. Just when they were setting up the door is suddenly opened and several crossbow bolts are fired before the door is closed again. Little Claw decided to burst through the door before transforming into his bear form. He is confronted not only by several fiends and well as some human thugs, but what appeared to be 2 flayed people crucified whoes slow death seemed to be giving power to an orb that was inturn powering a portal.
  
  During the battle Angus notices that the portal seems to be almost powered and lets the rest of the party know. Mal takes matters into his own hands and shoots one of the flayed men which kills him. Unfortunately this sends a pulse of power to the the orb. Little Claw then tries to dispel magic to sever the link between the other flayed man and the orb, which works briefly before the connection re-establishes. Meanwhile after trying to hide behind Eli for cover, Cig decided to take a brave pill and charge towards one of the remaining thugs.
  
  Once all the hostiles where defeated, the party argues about whether or not to save the flayed man or to put him out of his misary. Mal argues for killing him while Little Claw insists on healing him. Little Claw wins the arguement and starts trying to heal him and the flayed man screams in pain. Using what painkillers he has, Little Claw manages to reduce the noise to a whimper. Meanwhile Eli and Angus notice that the portal has fully opened and the peer through it ot see a clearing surrounded by trees. Eli also notices a shape heading towards the portal and backs away. Another fiend jumps through and battle is joined again.
  
  After defeating the fiend Angus looks for a way to shut down the portal but any method he can think of would need the party be far way to avoid any damage so they decide to leave it for now and continue to explore. They find some empty empty rooms before finding another locked door. Little Claw attempted to crowbar the door open which triggered a flame trap which Mal and Mal managed to avoid leaving Angus (and Caid) and Little Claw to take the brunt of the damage. The locked door leads to a small treasure room where they find some gold, art and what appears to be magical dust and rope. Also on a bookshelve Angus finds some expensive looking books.
  
  Finding another room but hearing beathing, Little Claw turns into a mouse and crawls under the door to find what looks like a study with a large human male standing by a desk starring at the wall. After watching him for several minutes where he doesn't move a muscle, Little Claws messages the rest of the party to move into the room. They start looking round the room when Little Claw hears foot steps coming from one of the walls. Before they can prepare a hidden door is opened revealing a robe man who looks surprised by the visitors. After a brief dialog, comabt starts with the robed man telling the large human to defend him and then turns to ELi and dominating her. Little Claw transforms into an octapus and tries to grapple with the robed man. Seeing this ELi turns her bow on Little Claw and the large human also attacks him. This leaves Little Claw unconcious. The rest of the party manages to damage the robed man enough to force him to flee and Eli shrugs off the domination effect and turns on the large man. Eli and Cig notice a glowing collar around his neck hidden by his shirt. Cig's attempt to remove it fails but while he was pulling on the collar, Mal unleashings a flurry of magic missiles from his wnad which tears through the man's neck, beheading him and causing Cig to fall backwards and landing on his arse, collar in hand and a head on his lap.

Several books on the bookcases. Investigation roll 15+ 1 of the books is the same as the manuscript.
If they work out that it is the decoder roll Investigation 15+ to decipher the following.

The agreement has been made. Start the process and begin gathering the necessary ingredients.  

Ensure no one enters the Blackpine Forrest. Those loggers almost stumbled upon us. It is too early for us to be found out as we have little in terms of defences at the moment.  

Phase one is complete, the runestones have been constructed and will hide us from view. We can initiate phase two. Start the talks with T  

The gamble with the tribesmen is paying off and they are providing us with enough people to begin making the payments to fulfil the agreement. You can inform T that he may start.  

T is becoming too demanding. Deal with him.

Several have the letter T.
