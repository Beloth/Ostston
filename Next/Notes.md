#Next Session

###Last Session
Went to Winyfred's Wonderous wares. Got Angus's Guild Identification. Bought +1 arrows. Angus got told to meet at the library Investigator Trent.  
2 other Investigators with Trent, Rasvull and Delee. Told him of the disappearance of his mentor Caelom. Rasvull treats Angus as a suspect.  Trent playing politics and while he doesn't help Angus does not arrest him. Delee secretly helps Angus by leaving investigation notes out for him to read. Also tells him that the trinket given to him by the farmers daughter has a magical tracking on it.  
Angus uses the notes to track down where the Caelom was last see, the Jolly Workman's Inn. Found that Caelom had a posh visitor the day before his disappearance. Cig has encounter with barmaid called Betsy. Investigated Caelom's room. Found a book linked to his diary and directions to a house in the noble quarter.  


###This Session
####Initial description
Finished the investigation of Caelom's room at the Jolly Workman.  
Little Claw - bloodhound  
at 11am in the Jolly Workman inn  



#####Caelom's Book
Angus recognises the book as one of many that Robert had in his study. They were linked to his notebook so that what ever he wrote in the notebook would appear in the symatheptic book. The symatheptic book would also appear to be one of the normal books on The Natural History of Hestal (volume 13) unless open in a special way.

Arcana check
* Failed the book appears to be inert
* DC5+ take 1D4 damage as spark of magical feedback hits you 
* DC10+ You almost had it but the true book remains hidden
* DC15+ it opens reveling the true book

Angus has not taken the investigation into his handling of the Necormancer well. Hopefully getting out of my shadow and a bit of adventuring with out me will dampen that arrogance that may hamper his future advancement in the guild.

**A few uninteresting entries**

Word has reached me through one of my contacts in Ostston that a rare Manusrcipt has been unearthed. I think I'll head there and investigate. Anything to get away from that pain in the arse Rasvull.

**Skip a few entries**

Talked to my contact and it appears that Lord Darrel has the Manuscript. Will try to gain an audiance to talk to him but 1st need to find a place to stay. The Jolly Workman was recommended as being close to the noble quarter and at being a decent price

**Next entry**  

I think I'm going to have to talk to my contact about taking money for recommendations. Thats the only reason I can think of for why he recommended me this inn. The innkeeper was nice enough and even gave me a good deal on a months rent. However its in the craftsman quarter and who in their right mind wants to be woken up before dawn by the ringing on hammers!

Met with the steward of Lord Darrel but was unable to convice him to let me talk to the Lord

**Next day**
Those damn hammers!

Gained an audiance with Lord Darrel. He was helpful enough but unfortunately sold the manuscript on. He did mention that what he wad told the manuscript contained information on the lower planes.

Started to ask around about who might be interested in the lower planes in the city and so might have bought the manuscript  

**Next day**
Hmmm Betsy provides a fine distraction from the early morning wake up. Unfortunely I doubt I can afford many such mornings. The foolish girl thinks that I didn't she her slip out with my pouch but she earnt it.

There appears to be several pages dedicated to some sort magical construct.

Arcana check 
* DC10 some variation on a silencing spell
* DC15 He appears to have been attempting to create a small localised silence spell taht could be cast on an item and that would last 8 hours. The diagrams of ears suggest where he wanted the item to go

Apparently word of my interest in the manuscript has spread. Lady Granrus has invited me to tea. She apparently has information on who bought the manuscript

#####Directions
Intelligence Check DC 13+ to try to match the directions up with Ostston
* Failed takes you 4 hours of wondering around, talking to people trying to match up locations to the directions   
* After an hour you manage to find where the directions lead too.

Leads to Lady Granrus house but need to ask around to find that out 

#####Lady Granrus
You knock on the door. A butler opens the door "Yes?"  

"Please wait here" In the hall way  
"Lady Granrus will see you in the morning room"  He leads you to a well lit room where Lady Granrus is reclining on a chaise longue

Lady Granrus is a middle aged lady in an expensive low cut dress. Heavily made up and an intricate hair style
"Visitors. How lovely." She looks you over "not the usual type that visit me I must admit... so what do you do?" She takes a sip from her wine glass. "Where are my manners.. Drink?"   
"My guests tend to want their privicy. why should I tell you anything" with a smile

Angus perception check
Success you notice a glint under the side table, it appears to be a ring. A ring you recognise as one belonging to Robert.

"Fine yes he was here. Unfortunately for him I ran into a little problem and my way out was to slip a little something into his wine" She looks with amusment at your glass.  
"It was merely a sleep potion though to be fair he looked pretty tired anyway. Then some people took him away"

"Luckily for you I didn't like the way my problem, how shall I put it, used me, so I had some associates follow them."  
"What would you be willing to give me for this information?"

Some sort of check
She is very clever and unlikely to do anything for free

"Very well, he was taken to disused warehouse outside of the north gate. I'll have someone show you the way"  
See rings a small bell and the butler enters
"Ah Jooves please have Weester direct these fine people to the place he has been watching"
"Of course milady".

"Follow me" pauses "and try not to look too conspious"  
He leads to out of the house and you head towards the North gate, you go through and you head towards the river but he leads you through the back streets until you reach a side door to a small building. He looks you over. Wait here. He ducks into the building. About 5 mins later he returns looking completely different. He's wearing what appears to be dock workers clothing. Face aand arms look like they've been darken by the sun and a small scar on his cheek.  

"Right you will trail me keeping me just in sight. I will stop and pretend I have a stone in my shoe at the building you are interested, at which point I'll move off and you will not see me again. Understood?"

####Summons to the council
A few days later they recieve a summons to the council to explain the situation.  
They are escorted through the busy hallways by 2 guards. Lots of people wlking though the hallways, servants, guards and others. You are lead into what appears to be a throne room where there appears to be a queue to one of the side doors on the other side to which you are being lead

Perception check (DC18+)  
You notice a figure hiding in the shadows that appears to be watching you

you enter what seems to be a waiting room where 2 guards stand by the door. A clerk sits at a desk and motions to some seats. Please take a seat the council will see you soon  

Perception check

* 10+ you hear raised voices but can't really make out what is being said  
* 15+ their is an obvious disagreement within the council. Several are disbelieving  
* 20+ Male voice seems to be the most veriment in his disbelieve and calls into question the envidence  

####Council Room
Well appointed room with high ceilings and a large glass window letting in a lot of light. Large rectangle table dominated the room arround which sits the council. At the head is Lady Gellantara, Lord Tanafrey, Steward Belorn and Archanist Shaniera on her right and Priestess Val'oren, High Merchant Xavier and High Marshal Felarn on her left.

High Marshal Felarn stands and introduces you to them. Lady Gellantara and councillors this is the party who brought news of Hillards fall and the portal to which our subjects were taken through.

"Hmm they don't look like much." The figure sitting at the right hand of Lady Gallentara (Lord Tanafrey)  
"Their tale matches with the reports I'm getting" replies Felarn  
"Reports that are obviously too late for us to do anything about" retorts Tanafrey  
"And the Marshal of Highcastle will pay for his incompetancy. You was it that pushed for his promotion in the 1st place!"  
"Why you..." Tanafrey looks to stand  
"Enough!" shouts Lady G "Enough this arguing will get us no where"  
"Agreed" the female half elf. "perhaps questioning this party would be a better use of our time than rehashing old arguments"  
She turns to you "tell me of this portal and the one who held it open"  

Lady G
"Thank you for your time... you will receive a bonus.. High Marshal Felarn please take care of it and show them out" A clear dismissal of Felarn. Tanafrey looks smug  

Felarn walks you out and takes a pouch from the clerks desk. "Follow me." He takes you to what is obviously his office. Gives you the pouch (holds a further 500gp)  
"I had hoped the council will allow me to boost the number of guards due to your testimony but Tanafrey obviously has the ear of Lady G at the moment and has blocked that. I can't afford to go directly against him at this time."  
"If you are interested I may have jobs for you in the future, but I will need to wait a while otherwise it would be too obvious. That is if you are interested?"

"In the mean time if you are looking for work you could head to the Order of the Anvil. I'll write you an introductory note which will get you a meeting with Roszana who is incharge of the handing out the contracts.

####Exploring the Merchant Quarter
If the prosperity of a city can be determine by the amount and varity of the goods sold by it merchants that by all accounts Ostston is a very prosperous place. There are merchants here selling everything from spices to furniture to magic items.

Perceptions check 
* 10+ the is a subtle undercurrent of worry
* 15+ Though there still appears to be many things on sale there does seem to be a number of empty shelves

After a time exploring

Angus make a perception check

* 10+ You think you saw somthing important but you don't know what or why
* 15+ You saw something in one of the shop windows that bugs you. Thinking back and using your keen mind you recall the shop selling wooden items, chairs, tables, musical insturments, wait, there it is, the whistle, exactly the same style as Eli's.



 

####Order of the Anvil

As you approch it is less of a guild hall and more of a massive stone fortification 3 stories high. 2 heavily armed guards stand at the side of the thick open wooden doors. You can see several guards standing on the roof looking down.

You enter a large central hall which is busy with people. Several desks are at the sides manned by clerks with queues of people waiting to talk to them. Many large notice boards are scattered around the hall with what appears to be little notes pinned to them. There are clusters of people around the boards looking at the notes and a few taking some down.  

Several clerks holding piles of notes walk through the hall putting new notes onto the various boards.  
One of these clerks walks by you and stops "You look lost. Can I help you?"

"This is the contracts hall. Each of those boards holds various jobs that the guild has taken on. Guild members, adventuring parties and mercanaries bands can have a look and if a job looks like something they would be interested in completing they take the note to one of the desks, gets more information and signs up for it".  

You have a message for Lady Lemia? Very well" He flags down a clerk who had just finished pinning up new jobs on a nearby board and hands him his stack of jobs "Follow me" He leads you to a side door that has 2 guards standing by. "Wait here" He knocks and enters closing the door. Hard to here over the noise of the hall.

Door opens and the clerk beckonds you in. 
You see a female hafling sitting behind a large desk that has several trays full of the same job notes in them. "You have a message for me? Quickly now I'm very busy"  
"Hmm a recommendation from the High Marshal, you don't see many of those around"  
"I am the Mistress of Contracts here at the Order of the Anvil. Do you know how the contracts work?"  
"Those contracts out there" She waves towards to door "are for junior guild members who have yet to prove themselves to the guild, unaffliated adventuring groups and mercenaries"  

"They are generally not the best paids jobs but need to be done"  
"The more lucative jobs are saved for proven guild members. Now this note from the High Marshal says you have done him a good turn and he would look upon the Order favorably if we were to accept you"  
"Do you wish to join the Order?"  

"While the Marshal's note does paint you in a good light you will need take on a contract and be assessed by a qualified member before we classify you as being proved, and I have just the job and possibly you assessor"  
She shuffles through some paper "Yes here we are. The Tolnar Mausoleum and Dormak Firebeard"  
"Meet Dormak Firebeard at the Northen gate at dawn tomorrow"
