#Next Session

###Last Session
Accessed Caolem's book and found out what he was looking for. Attempted to gain an audiance with Lord Darrell but only got a vague assurance that when he was available he would contact them. Angus summoned his familiar from the Fey Caid and used her to to scout Lady Granrus's estate. He then disguised himself as a Dragonborn (Investigator Rasvull) and gained an audiance with Lady Granrus. Found out that inorder to pay some debts she had Caolem drugged and allowed him to be dragged away, but she felt ill used and had them followed. Had Weester show Angus where they took him, however he spotted that the rest of the party were trailing them and assumed they were hostile. Tried to lose them before heading to a safe house where he changed his appearance, then lead them to a warehouse. Cig managed to pickpocket a leaving clerks pocket for a bunch (5) keys.

Left the warehouse until the evening when they found a slightly opened window and Little Claw and Mal enter. Mal causes the guards to fall asleep and tied them up. Both Eli and Cig fail to climb up to the window. Attempts to open the back door also fail so they pull Eli and Cig up to the open window. Angus uses the keys to open the front door and walks in.

Little Claw knocks on the office door and nut hits the clerk when he opens it. He then attempts to grapple him to the floor but fails and ends up hanging round the clerks neck. Angus proceeds to knock out the clerk who falls onto Little Claw causing damage. The clerk is then tied up and Angus attempts to murder him but forcing the gag further down his throat. Eli and Little Claw combine to stop the attempt. Mean while Mal has decided to beat the 2 tied up guards into unconciousness.

The clerk is taken into the other room and away from Angus who then spots the trap door under the chest. After Cig checks for traps and unlocks the chect they find 2000 gp.

####Local leader of the Shadow League
Old Gnome. Grey hair with a beard. Looks quite frail.

* "Well what do we have here... intruders"
* Gnomes have advantage on Int +2, Wis +3 and Cha +1 magic saving throws.
* "You are trepassing on our territory." Turns to Cig "You at least should know better to come down here uninvited"
* "Even if you manage to kill me and mine, at least one will escape to spread your likeness around and you'll never leave the city alive"
* "Price of exit will be..." looks at the party evaluating their worth. "500gp each"
* "The price of joining will be... " He smiles maliciously "500gp each".


####Summons to the council
A few days later they recieve a summons to the council to explain the situation.  
They are escorted through the busy hallways by 2 guards. Lots of people wlking though the hallways, servants, guards and others. You are lead into what appears to be a throne room where there appears to be a queue to one of the side doors on the other side to which you are being lead

Perception check (DC18+)  
You notice a figure hiding in the shadows that appears to be watching you

you enter what seems to be a waiting room where 2 guards stand by the door. A clerk sits at a desk and motions to some seats. Please take a seat the council will see you soon  

Perception check

* 10+ you hear raised voices but can't really make out what is being said  
* 15+ their is an obvious disagreement within the council. Several are disbelieving  
* 20+ Male voice seems to be the most veriment in his disbelieve and calls into question the envidence  

####Council Room
Well appointed room with high ceilings and a large glass window letting in a lot of light. Large rectangle table dominated the room arround which sits the council. At the head is Lady Gellantara, Lord Tanafrey, Steward Belorn and Archanist Shaniera on her right and Priestess Val'oren, High Merchant Xavier and High Marshal Felarn on her left.

High Marshal Felarn stands and introduces you to them. Lady Gellantara and councillors this is the party who brought news of Hillards fall and the portal to which our subjects were taken through.

"Hmm they don't look like much." The figure sitting at the right hand of Lady Gallentara (Lord Tanafrey)  
"Their tale matches with the reports I'm getting" replies Felarn  
"Reports that are obviously too late for us to do anything about" retorts Tanafrey  
"And the Marshal of Highcastle will pay for his incompetancy. You was it that pushed for his promotion in the 1st place!"  
"Why you..." Tanafrey looks to stand  
"Enough!" shouts Lady G "Enough this arguing will get us no where"  
"Agreed" the female half elf. "perhaps questioning this party would be a better use of our time than rehashing old arguments"  
She turns to you "tell me of this portal and the one who held it open"  

Lady G
"Thank you for your time... you will receive a bonus.. High Marshal Felarn please take care of it and show them out" A clear dismissal of Felarn. Tanafrey looks smug  

Felarn walks you out and takes a pouch from the clerks desk. "Follow me." He takes you to what is obviously his office. Gives you the pouch (holds a further 500gp)  
"I had hoped the council will allow me to boost the number of guards due to your testimony but Tanafrey obviously has the ear of Lady G at the moment and has blocked that. I can't afford to go directly against him at this time."  
"If you are interested I may have jobs for you in the future, but I will need to wait a while otherwise it would be too obvious. That is if you are interested?"

"In the mean time if you are looking for work you could head to the Order of the Anvil. I'll write you an introductory note which will get you a meeting with Roszana who is incharge of the handing out the contracts.

####Exploring the Merchant Quarter
If the prosperity of a city can be determine by the amount and varity of the goods sold by it merchants that by all accounts Ostston is a very prosperous place. There are merchants here selling everything from spices to furniture to magic items.

Perceptions check 
* 10+ the is a subtle undercurrent of worry
* 15+ Though there still appears to be many things on sale there does seem to be a number of empty shelves

After a time exploring

Angus make a perception check

* 10+ You think you saw somthing important but you don't know what or why
* 15+ You saw something in one of the shop windows that bugs you. Thinking back and using your keen mind you recall the shop selling wooden items, chairs, tables, musical insturments, wait, there it is, the whistle, exactly the same style as Eli's.



 

####Order of the Anvil

As you approch it is less of a guild hall and more of a massive stone fortification 3 stories high. 2 heavily armed guards stand at the side of the thick open wooden doors. You can see several guards standing on the roof looking down.

You enter a large central hall which is busy with people. Several desks are at the sides manned by clerks with queues of people waiting to talk to them. Many large notice boards are scattered around the hall with what appears to be little notes pinned to them. There are clusters of people around the boards looking at the notes and a few taking some down.  

Several clerks holding piles of notes walk through the hall putting new notes onto the various boards.  
One of these clerks walks by you and stops "You look lost. Can I help you?"

"This is the contracts hall. Each of those boards holds various jobs that the guild has taken on. Guild members, adventuring parties and mercanaries bands can have a look and if a job looks like something they would be interested in completing they take the note to one of the desks, gets more information and signs up for it".  

You have a message for Lady Lemia? Very well" He flags down a clerk who had just finished pinning up new jobs on a nearby board and hands him his stack of jobs "Follow me" He leads you to a side door that has 2 guards standing by. "Wait here" He knocks and enters closing the door. Hard to here over the noise of the hall.

Door opens and the clerk beckonds you in. 
You see a female hafling sitting behind a large desk that has several trays full of the same job notes in them. "You have a message for me? Quickly now I'm very busy"  
"Hmm a recommendation from the High Marshal, you don't see many of those around"  
"I am the Mistress of Contracts here at the Order of the Anvil. Do you know how the contracts work?"  
"Those contracts out there" She waves towards to door "are for junior guild members who have yet to prove themselves to the guild, unaffliated adventuring groups and mercenaries"  

"They are generally not the best paids jobs but need to be done"  
"The more lucative jobs are saved for proven guild members. Now this note from the High Marshal says you have done him a good turn and he would look upon the Order favorably if we were to accept you"  
"Do you wish to join the Order?"  

"While the Marshal's note does paint you in a good light you will need take on a contract and be assessed by a qualified member before we classify you as being proved, and I have just the job and possibly you assessor"  
She shuffles through some paper "Yes here we are. The Tolnar Mausoleum and Dormak Firebeard"  
"Meet Dormak Firebeard at the Northen gate at dawn tomorrow"
