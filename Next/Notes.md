###Last Session 31 - 2nd Feb

* The party cotinued to explore the temple. You came across a Large, solid metal door with no visible locks. After investigating the door, Archanist Shaniera spots magical writing that seems to be protecting the door.
* At the same time she notices that there is similar writing on the walls that are more faded than those on the doors. You think this writing is linked to the shield preventing the ghosts from entering this level of the temple. 
* Clusters of the writing are also found that seems to be powering the enchantment and after a while Shaniera manages to untangle the cluster. She postulates that if you destory 5-6 of the clusters this my reduce the shield enough to allow the ghosts access.
* Continuing on you entered a room which not only contain the captain of the Lord Tanafrey's personal guard but also uncovered a hidden teleporter.
* The teleporter took you to a set of rooms that contained a small treasure room as well as a small shrine at which you made several offerings to Meliekki.
* You then found a cell with a beaten up Polarna. After questioning her you release her on the condition she tells you everything she knows about this place and the plans taking place.
* After trying to take her with you, her injured state slows you down to such an extent you decide to send her back to a safe area to wait.
* You also decide to send Shaniera back though the explored areas to disable any cluster you passed by.
* You find the last secret passage way that leads to the central room and open the door to reveal...


###Next Session 32 - ?



####Door 1
* Solid metal door.
  * Investigation
    * DC5 - No lock, no handle.
    * DC10 - Newly installed door 
    * DC15 - Doesn't seem to be any obvious method of opening the door
    * DC20+ - As you inspect the door more closely you can just about make out some sort of markings on the door. It looks almost like some sort of symbol. 
      * If Mal inspects it intelligance/arcana check DC10+. Appears to be related to the infernal language. You can gather the basic gist of it. Protection or defense 
      * Anyone else DC 15+. Appears to be related to the infernal language. You can gather the basic gist of it. Protection or defense 
      * Failed check - definitely magical but you're not sure what.
    
  * Attempting to open the door. No lock no handle so how are you trying?
    * Pushing on the door make a strength check. No matter the roll no affect. If high roll (25+) you push so hard you actually do damage to yourself (1D4 damage)
    * Attacking the door physically. Roll attack AC 10+. If hit roll damage - as soon as you make contact with the door an explosion of force erupts. 
      * Everyone within 10 feet of the door make a Dex save closest DC15+, next DC10. Success takes half damage. Damage = 2xDamage rolled.
    * Attacking the door with magic. As you release the magic you see writing start to light up. Shaniera's eyes widen and she shouts out "RUN". Everyone within 30 feet of the door make a Dex saving room. Closest DC17, next 15, next 13, next 11, etc. Anyone successful manages to scramble out of the way. All that fail take 2D6 magical force damage and are knocked prone. 
  
  * If the writing is spotted and mentioned then Shaniera will have a look. She takes out from a small pouch at her side what looks like a eye monocle. She places it in her eye and takes a close look. "Hmmm obviously magic, recently empowered. Looks like someone doesn't want anyone entering in here." 
    * If they haven't seen the runes that block the ghosts this is the point at which Shaniera will point them out.
      * She turns away from the door, hand half way to take off the monocle, then stops and stares at the wall. Her eyes widen and she approaches the wall. "There's more writing here, more faded" She starts tracing her finger along the wall, deep in thought.
      * Investigation DC 10+ to spot the runes. See [above] (#runes-blocking-the-ghosts)
      


####Main Room

? Think about lair actions. Center of Meilikki's power but corrupted. If still corrupted bad actions hurt party. If cleansed good actions help party.
* The room is dominated by a large statue of a horned Devil with a large wing span. 4 large eyes glowing eerily.
* The centre orb is has thick reddish black veins growing up from the base. The parts not covered by the veins is glowing a sickly blue colour.
* In the Centre you see a large winged fiend slumped to 1 knee surround by some sort of force field. A line of energy connecting it to the center orb.
* Red lines of power leave the central orb hitting 2 tieflings standing by the orbs. You see their faces twisted in ecstasy. They are visibly vibrating with energy, wings outspread. 
  * Passive perception 15+ You also see smaller lines of purply blue energy leaving them and hitting the other orbs
* In front of the statue a rift appears to be forming

* If Mal gets within 20ft of the centre orb a line of power lances out from it striking him in the chest
  *  Wisdom saving throw 10+. Every round increases difficulty by 1
    * If failed. You are overwhelped by a feeling of ecstasy. You utter a low moan of pleasure and are unable to resist the pull of the power line as it moves you 10 ft into position infront of the closest orb
    * If successful movement reduced to 5ft. Its trying to drag you into a position infront of the closet orb
  * Will continue to try to connect until Mal leaves the room or the mage goes away.  
  * For every turn attached +1 to wings
* Ameria has an Ioun Stone Protection, Wand of the War Mage +1, potion of greater healing, Spell Scroll of Clairvoyance  

* Every round 1d6 ghosts will enter the room and float into the orb.

#####Lair action

* Meilikki's orb of power is corrupted and will hurt the party once a round. Pick a random member and one of the following happens:
  * They have to make a wisdom saving throw 12+. They are shown is vision one of the realms of the nine hells. If failed they are paralysised with fear for their next turn
  * A jolt of energy rushes from the orb and strikes them. Wisdom saving throw 12+. If successful half damage. 1d8 Psychic damage
  * A line of power reaches out from the orb and connects to the player. Make a dexterity saving throw 15+ to avoid it  
    * If failed. You are overwhelped by a feeling of ecstasy. You utter a low moan of pleasure and are unable to resist the pull of the power line as it moves you 10 ft into position infront of the closest orb and you can make no movement on your next turn. 
      * At the end of every turn make a wisdom saving throw DC12+ 
        * If successful you make to pull yourself away.
        * If failed take 1d4 psychic damage and pull 5 feet towards the position
      * If its Mal, will continue to try to connect until Mal leaves the room or the mage goes away. For every turn attached +1 to wings
      * If it pull the player into position then 1d8 psychic damage. No movement.
