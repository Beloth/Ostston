While the party rested Lieutenant Jeffery questioned the Gatekeeper Len. He confirmed that the man in the Captain's uniform is Delgarion. He was the person who hired him and several others to pretend to be guards. They that finished their part and left a few days ago. The last lot of goods and people left at the same time He was the last one left and was due to leave in a a day or so. He will be escorted to Ostston to testify to the Grand Marshall. If you could also go to testify about what you have found that would be most useful and you would be well rewarded.

The tattoo was found on all the bodies within the tower but not on Len. They also checked the tribesman bodies but none seemed to have the tattoo.

He's sent a patrol to Easthaven as well as starting the usual patrols from the tower. He'll be manning the tower till a relief force is sent from Ostston, after which he and his men will return to Highcastle.

- Fail "you eyes skim the stones nothing important there. You start to move away from the stone" 
- Success "you feel something external making you want to turn away from the stone circle. You fortify your self and with a shake of you head you brush off the suggestion"
	
In the centre of the stone circle lies an altar, bare except for a clear crystal on it. The crystal slowly pulses with a dim white light, almost like a heart beat. As you move closer the light gets brighter as does the pace of the beats. If you touch the crystal you hear a booming voice in your head... "You are not one of mine". The crystal turns red and there is bright red flash and an arcane explosion. 2D4 damage Acrobatics save DC 10 to half the damage.
	
Above the now red crystal forms a red mist and within that mist an indistict form appears. "Well what do we have here... More tributes perhaps.. no none of you are mine, well that's not entirely true is it." Mal you can feel a feeling of kinship towards the being. "now what to do with you..."
	
"No I think not. I can't have you interupting my plans." With that the crystals begins to pulse even faster and brighter. Those of a magical pursuasion feel a pull from their core.

 - Cig "How can you trust these people. You only just met them. They won't trust a thief. They just lulling you into a fasle sense of security. Betray them before they betray you"
 - Little Claw "How can you trust these people? They kill the creatures of the land so easily and with no remorse. They see them as beasts, pests to be removed. They would kill you family as easily as they kill the others after all they are just peast.. they see you as a pest.. stop them"
 - Eli - "He still keeps the whistle. The only link to you family. He's hiding it from you.. stopping you from finding them. He's the one that took them, he's trying to get rid of the evidence"
	 
The voice in your head is persasive and you belief it. You turn on your companions
