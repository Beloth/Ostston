#Next Session - 30th June

###Last Session

PArty followed the kidnapped Cig only to find him being rescued by Katrine (the Cat) who they recognise as the individual who lead them to one of the leaders of the Thieves guild. Helping her are 2 other men who Cig recognise as the pair that were trailing the party early. They give the party information on the thieves guild. They party headed back to the inn and after a rest they are contacted by Archanist Shaniera who informs them of the progress made with the portal. She requires a group that is not affiliated with Ostston to investigate the other side of the portal (Blackpine) in order to get round an ancient pact made between the founder of Ostston and some unknown group.

Passing through the portal the party confronts the devils there. After the fight that leaves Eli close to death and the others with various injuries the party frees the children shackled to a power orb.

DC20+ - The hairs on the back of your neck tingle. Someone or something is watching you.... You scan the tree line in the hopes of spotting what... there in the bush off the path... a pair of yellow eyes... and then they are gone...

DC20+ - There seems to be a rough path heading north, you can make out many sets of footprints all overlapping each other. Several days old at least. You can also make out the prints of several devils but these go in both directions.

###Following the tracks

Marching order?  

As you follow the tracks, the dark oppressive atmosphere you note when you were last here, and that had dissapated slight when you destroyed the crystal is back in force. If anything it is even greater than before. As you get further away from the clearing the feeling gets worse and worse. The forest gets darker, the tress loom either side of you casting shadows all around...

Make a Wisdom Saving throw

DC15+ with Eli and LC advantage

Eli and LC - you detected none of the usual sounds you would associate with the forrest except for the faint buzzing of insects.. no birds.. but then there is a howl!

LC make a perception check...

DC10+ - You feel eyes on you... you scan the the bushes to the side of the trail. 

DC15+ - You feel eyes on you... you scan the the bushes to the side of the trail. Peering from the bushes are a set of eyes looking back at you as you peer closer you can just about make out a face and as you make eye contact a wide smile makes its way onto what you now recognise as a male Hafling. The Hafling raises his hand to you and gives you a wave....

LC Make a athletics roll with Disadvantage against Giant Wolf

If failed - A heavy weight strikes against your back and you are unable to compensate. You crash to the floor, head tilted slight which probably saved your nose from being broken. As you look above you you see the golden eyes of a giant wolf panting above you. It licks you cheak before bounding back into the forest.

If sucessful -  A heavy weight strikes against your back, you stumble but manage to catch yourself before falling. You turn your head to see a giant wolf's head peering over your shoulder.

A Halfling bursts out of the bushes Runs to ELi and says "Elionara move.. quickly" grabs her and tries to pull her back into the bushes. At the same time he pulls out a water holder and throws it towards the rest of the party. As the liquid falls out of the holder the halfling mutters a few words and gestures towards the party, liquid shoots, mistyfying and hitting everyone in the party.

Eli make a athletics check to avoid being dragged..

Its your Uncle Eldorin.. a respected Druid of these forrests. "must be quite.. must be hidden.. quickly... move before they get here"

"Move.. before you get get us both caught...."

"These arn't your captors?... errr.. not good... not good at all... " There is another howl.. closer this time... "Run!"







####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
