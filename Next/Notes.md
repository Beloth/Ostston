#Next Session

###Last Session
Defeated the final lot of undead in the crypt including a Ghost. Argued about taking the treasure including 3 Opals, what appeared to be a bag of holding and some potions. Left all but the 3 Opals one of which appeared to be radiating necrotic energy. As they leave the mausoleum Angus is handed a letter by Jooves, from Lady Granrus. While researching the opal, Angus finds it is cursed and has attuned itself to him. Attempts to return it to the mausoleum fall as it magically returns to him. Clerics at the temple of Moradin attempt to remove the curse but fail. Tell Angus to return in the morning as they research it more. Little Claw donates much of this gold to the temple

Cig and Eli attempt to find a shady inn where Cig can make contact with the Shadow League but are distracted by a large gathering where they learn that a merchant is offering a large reward for information on the death of his son. They also see Weester and attempt to follow him but lose him as he enters a house.


###This Session

####Cursed Opal

If taken the Opal binds to whoever carries it for more than 10mins. That person is then cursed. For 1 ability type there are at a disadvantage.

Too get rid of the curse. Greater Restoration. Temples will expect a donation equvalent of 500gp.

#####At the temple

This is senior archavist Dorn Runebrow. Very old Dwarf, grey hair, large gold rimmed glasses. Carrying a staff in one hand and a large tomb in the other.

He put the tomb on the table and peers at Angus
"So you are the one who found a gem of Sidruis are you. Hmm let me have a look at you." Before Angus can react he's grab Angus's ear and yanked him down till he's roughly at eye level and is peering at differnt parts of your face. Eventually he releases you  
"Hmm .. not too far gone then. It might not be impossible to do." He turns to the senior cleric "You best tell him what it entails. I'll begin gathering the necessary bits" With then he leaves the room.  

"Please forgive him.. he has served this temple faithfully for several centuries but has never been the most.. diplomatic"   
"The gems of Sidruis are not technically cursed gems. They were orginially manufactured for a particular reason." He looks at you all. "you didn't happen to find another piece of jewellary where you found that gem by any chance? A ring or amulet? Something with a magical link to the gem? No, pity, that would have made things easier."  

He looks at the tomb. "Where was I, ah yes, manufactured. As you probably have guessed the gems are vamperic by nature but originally not for a necessarily evil reason. They were linked to a master gem. As those people holding the slave gems lost attributes the one holding the master gem would gain them. Once the gem had drained all it could the magic left the gem. This usually left the holder dead or close to it. It was used as a method for noble or rich families to make their children stronger, fast, cleverer...

Now I know this sounds evil but the original design was for the slave gems to be purely voluntary. You could not be accidentally attuned for forced to be so. Once done the gem was left as payment with the family of the holder. 

However the exchange was not 1 to 1. So the recipent would of someone's strength would not be as strong as that person. The rate varied from 10 to 1 to 100 to 1. Not only that but the cost of preparing the gems was exsorbatant, and so as time went on corners were cut, which led to gems such as the one you hold where you had no choice in accepting it. This lead to the practice being seen as evil and dying out.

"So how do we get it off you.... well as far as we can tell there are 2 options, neither of which are very good...

Option 1. You find the master gem. With it we can break the link. Unfortunately the gem could be anywhere, be part of any type of jewellary, its magics forgotten.

Option 2. He looks down. Normally I would never suggest this but with the way things are at the moment there will probably be enough volunteers... We can try to transfer the gem to someone else. Without the master gem this will be difficult but not impossible. However the process will be very draining on both you and the other person. The volunteer will want compensation for this as it is likely to make their life very difficult. 

#####Volunteer

Noris. Late 30's human male. Crippled. Both legs and an arm crushed in a cavein at one of the mines to the north. The arm and one leg had to be amputated. Brought back to Ostston several weeks ago. Has a young family. Willing to take it on for a stippend for his family. Place 1000gp with the Bank of Ostston from which a monthly stippend will be paid. If the gem and be sold at the end then that can form part of the payment.

#####Ritual to remove the curse
Both placed on beds next to each other with the Opal on a table between them. You have to draw you magical energy inwards. Concentrate on pulling it away from the opal. Chanting starts up from the surrounding clerics. The light seems to dim and to your surprise to can actually see thin dark tendrils attaching Angus to the opal. The chants intensifies and a cleric steps closer to Angus and seems to manipulate one of the tendrils, pulling it away from Angus. It resists but with the cleric pulling at it, its seems to enlongate until part of it can reach Noris and when it does it snaps into place causing both to scream out in pain. 1D4 damage. The cleric almost collapses and he fails back with another taking his place. 

Each time another 1D4 damage. Expending a spell level will reduce the damage by half per die. Total 5 tendrils to remove.

Banging on the door and in bursts a young woman. Holding a small baby. "No Noris, please" she's stop by the clerics from interferring. "Please no" she is weeping and trying to reach for him. "I'm sorry my love but this is for the best, please take her outside.. she doesn't need to see this" Several helpers take her outside.


####Returning to the Order
Need a name for the party
Rewarded with 750gp and a stamp/mark to stamp contracts with
"Congratulations on becoming members of the Order of the Anvil"

Barracks to stay. Commision weapons and armour. Training in martial ways. As you gain more reputation you gain access to more lucative contracts.

"I will send word to the High Marshal"

####Investigation 

You will be rewarded for any informtion you bring me regarding these cultists and where our missing citizens are. Awaiting the results of the Sages investigation into the rogue mages and the crystal pieces. Archanist Shaniera is also do some investigation herself. As you leave you notice Lord Tanafrey talking urgently to a female elf. If you try to hear them they will spot you and fall silent and sneer at you and walk away. If you was about her you find that she is an advisor to Tanafrey. Lady Yordel. Magic user. Aloof. Doesn't talk to many people.

#####Toys
Marshal suggests visiting the craftsman quarters.
Investigation check DC 10+ After wondering around the craftsmans quarters you notice that several shop signs have small patterns similar to the ones on the toys on them
DC 15+ you find a sign with the same symbol as Eli's whistle.

Talking to the owner, the marks indicate which apprentice made the item. It was a pratice brought in long ago. He points to a wall where many symbols hang. These are all the apprentices that learnt their craft in this very shop and have gone on to greater things. 

Looking at the whistler "Yes this is something we would have an apprentice make. It would help teach them precision" "While we do try to sell them to give a bit of additional income to the appentice, they rarely sell so we tend to wait till there is a small stockpile and then donate them to a local orphanage." The last one would have been about a month ago to the Our Lady's orphange just outside the city to the East. It is about an hours walk from the city. Not necessarily that particualr one.

#####Orphanage
Seems very quite. Metal fence, gate appears wide open. If they look round the back there is what appears to be a recent burial. Front door slightly ajar. As you search the place it looks deserted. 

######Office
Ransacked. Nothing of value left. Dried blood on the floor.

######Dining Room
Rows of tables for maybe 30 people plus a raised table. On the raised table appears to be bowls of food for 5 people.

#####1st floor

######Bedroom

Open the door DEX DC5+ roll to avoid a dagger strike from a young girl(10ish) (Attck roll 1d20 damage 1d4)

Convince her that the party is there to help: DC10+ . Several (4) other children emerge from the wardrobe. All younger than the 1st (4-6)

Eldest gets the rest to go downstairs to finish their meal. She tells the party that before she came her she used to live on the streets and she recognised some of the language the men were using. Thieves cant.
