#Next Session - 30th June

###Last Session

The party followed a path north from the protal clearing. The noticed they were being followed and attempted to set up an ambush by climbing up some trees.While there they are surrounded by Hell Wolves so they attempt to flee of the backs of conjured giant owls. A devil packmaster appeared as they were about to do so and downs the owl carrying Cig forcing the party to fight. During the fight a druidic Halfling appears with his companion wolf Rebel to help. After defeating the devils the halfling is revealed to be Eli's Uncle Eldorin who ushers the party quickly away. He leads them to a hidding whole where is becomes apparent that he's not all there.

After Little Claw casts lesser restoration on him his mind becomes clearer and he tells the party what he knows. Mal convinces him that he has a important mission to help the remaining memebers of his tribe. THe next morning the party awakens to find Eldorin gone. They decide to head to the camp to the east

They manage to avoid most of the shape changed imps who are keeping a look out to discover a large clearing. Reaching the edge of the camp, the party sees a large number of what appears to be prisoners with collars arounf their necks. They also see a few guards around who also appear to be collared. A patrols of hell wolves enters the camp and heads to one of the buildings from which emerges another of the fiends that they had just fought.

###This Session








####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
