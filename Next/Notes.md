####Cig's capture

Tracking Cig's kidnappers

Survivability check

#####10+ takes about 15mins to find their trail  
The party finds Cig unconcious along with 3 bodies of the kidnappers. Around them are 3 people dressed in dark clothing, hoods up with with only theirs eys visable above the cloth covering the rest of their faces. 1 in kneeling is front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

#####15+ takes about 5-10 mins to find the trail  
The party finds Cig unconcious with 2 of the kidnappers dead and the last one being double teamed.  1 in kneeling is front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

#####20+ finds the trail quickly  
The party finds Cig unconcious with 1 dead assassin and 2 others being confronted by 3 cloaked people. After combat ends 1 kneels in front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

"Stand down" the kneeling woman says as you approach, "their his friends". They sheath their weapons but maintain their defesive positions. Cig comes to conciousness when the woman waves something under his nose. After a moment she helps Cig to his feet.

Cig roll perception check with disadvantage. Unless really high she takes the dagger that you had secreted on your person.

Once Cig is able to stand by himself she removes her hood and pulls down the cloth covering her mouth. You recognise her as the woman (Katrine) that you met you showed you to the meeting place for the thieves guild (and the tunnels).

Cig roll a perception check 10+ the other 2 are familiar to you, 15+ you recognise the other 2 as the ones that had followed you when you were looking for those scouts way back when

"You should have been more wary. Your description has been sent out to all and there has been talk of a hefty bounty for your head."

She turns and stands in front of one of the cloaked men.  

"Explain what you can. I need to get back... you know what to do..." as she hands him the dagger.

He nods. Before anyone can react he lashes out with his fist striking her across the jaw. He catches her before she can fall. She spits out some blood. 

If the party tries to intervene she holds out her hand "Stop. Its necessary... wouldn't want it to look like I got away without any damage..." She tries to wink at you but winces...

With that she braces herself and nods again at the cloaked man. He swipes at her with Cig's dagger causing a shallow wound. She gasps and covers the wound with her hands. 

She takes a breath, takes a breath "Right.. get going..." she stumbles down one of the side alleys.

"Follow us.. quietly" 

Everyone make a stealth roll. Group DC 10

The cloaked men lead back into the merchants quarters via the back alleys. They stop behind a general goods store where there are some large broken crates, bags and other assorted rubbish. You see then take a quick look around before reaching behind the rubblish and the whole lots seems to lift slightly and then swing outwards revealing stairs down. The 2 men enter... one walking swiftly down the stairs the other standing in the enterance and motioning you down with some urgency. 

TAs you head down you see a lantern has been lit and you enter a plain room which has a simple table and a couple of chairs as well as sleeping mats in 1 corner. There is a cuboard with a couple of shelves of what looks to be dried rations.

"We don't have much time but I can answer a couple of you questions" looking at Cig.

* The price on Cig's head came originally from the King of the Slums and hasn't be recinded
* However it was the Old Tinkerer ordered your capture, motivations unknown. In a way that was lucky as it allowed the Kat (Katrine) to run interferance
* She is their contact here, believe that although she is part of the Old Tinkerer's crew she actually works for the Ostston Guildmaster.
* Her benefactor wants to know who ordered Borivik's death but they can't be seen to be actively looking in this area.
* She has been told to aid you were possible without blowing her cover
* She doesn't think that the Ostston Guildmaster is involved
* The leaders of the various districts are scambling for power at the moment especially with the death of the the Slum Lord.
* Suggests to stay out of the Sewers for now. Not safe there for Cig and might not be safe for the rest of the Hand considering the Old Tinkerer knows of you now.
* Any chance of quietly investigating your friends death has been blown. At least within the Craftsman and Slum chapters of the guild. 
* Advice to lay low until the new leader of the Slums chapter is appointed.
 
Once all questions have been answered they lead you back out of the room.


####Arcahnist Shaniera
She meets you at the Springwell Inn. "Good morning. If I could have a moment of your time. I have arranged for a private room"

She leads you into a side room where a table and chairs for all of you has been setup. She closes the door and sits. Once you are all sat she retrieves what appears to be a golden egg from her robe and places it on the centre of the table. She touches it briefly with her finger and you see a slight spark of magical energy. The sides of the egg slide down lifting the the revealed gem higher off the table. It starts to pulse with a blue light and then therea column of blue energy the shoots upwards for about 4 feet and a dome apears around the table surronding you all.

"There now.. we should be safe from any magical or mudane eavesdroppers"

"I have finished my inital research into the portal and have found some disturbing informtion. Information I feel needs acting upon without the Marshal"

"It appears that you were correct. It is a portal to the Blackpine Forrest. That in itself is not a problem as there are several teleportation circles around the city alhtough none to Blackpine as far as I am aware. The fact that it was under the city in the hands of the some unknows however is a concern but something that we can deal with"

"The power orb is a whole different level. As you probably gathered it was created using blood magics but it wasn't used just to activate the portal, although that was one use. It looks like it was designed to be self sustaining once a certain level of power was reached. Once in that state it could then be used to power anything that could be linked to it and that is what I think its true purpose was. Some sort of heart stone. I have heard of such things, at the University for example there is said to be an imense potectiveheart stone that powers the wards. A heart stone powered by blood magics however... I cannot comprehend what that would be used for but I would not have been anything good.  I have begun the process of leeching the power from it slowly and purifing said energy, but it will take time to do so fully and is not without its risks.

"The fact that the portal and power orb was created under Ostston with out anyone noticing is also worring. That level of magics should have tripped every alarm, every wards that any mage had setup in Ostston. That it didn't means that someone or something powerful is behind it. In fact I can think of only a handful at most in the Sages that could have done it."

"And the questions remains, why Blackpine Forest, was it to bring something into Ostston or take something out of Ostston?"

"As I did not know much about Blackpine Forest I asked Belorn (the Steward) for whatever information the area that was avaliable. What I found was... interesting... Ostston apparently has a treaty in place, a very old treaty dating back to before Hestal was formed, infact before Ostston was a true city state. The treaty states that in return for help Lord Ost renouces all claims to the forest. A clause in the treaty also states that no agent of Ost may enter the forest without incurring a penalty. What that penalty is is obscurred by some powerful magic but next to the clause was a hand written note by Lord Ost himself claiming that the penalty was great and that none should risk it. 

In addition there was a clause that should they need more help Ost would to provide a harvest and help would be given. Below which was a large space and 2 dates. 109BU (Before Unification) and 18PU (Post Unification)"

** 109BU plague hits Ostston
** 18PU poor havest and famine hits Ostston

"Belorn also told me that the scroll the treaty is written on is one of the items that every Lord of Ostston must swear upon when they take up the mantle. The late Lord Gallentara took such an oath but his son has yet to take it. This swearing invokes some sort of magic but I have not yet managed to determine what it does."

"This brings us to you." She turns to Angus "You have sworn no oaths to Ostston and so are not an agent of Ostston" She stands up straighter more formal "As a representative of the Sages of the Arcane I request that you investigate the other side of the portal. Find out what is happening and why this portal has been setup. Will you do this?".

"I can use some of the remaining power of the orb to open the portal so that you do not have to walk there. I will also give you this signal gem to indicate that I should reopen it to let you through" She hands you a small blue gem that glows slightly. "Just hold it in your hand and think of me.. I will be notified and will open the portal... it is one use however"


### Heading towards the Portal
The house above the portal is being guarded by the city guard. As you head down you sen more guards stationed there plus several of the Archanists assistants. The Archanist greets you as you enter the Portal room.
The Orb is still glowing but less that before. You notice arryed around the orb are 4 stands each holding a red, faintly glowing gem and lines of energy attaching the gems to the orb similar to the lines of energy that had connected the flayed men but the energy direction seems to be towards the gems rather than the other way round. 

"Are you ready"

At that she touches a rune on each the stands and the lines of energy cease.  From her robes she pulls out another gem similiar to those in the stands but this time clear (eg not red) but glowing brighter. "A purified gem" she says. She holds the gem towards the orb and she bows her head in concentration. A beam of white light connects from the gem to the orb. After a moment a beam streaks from the orb to the portal. Unlike the last time you saw the beam this one is not bright red, more of a pale pink colour. The portal starts to open. 

Like heat distortion before it clears


###Forest Clearing

As the portal opens it reveals the same clearing you saw before however this time ther appears to be something there. A closer look shows a small winged creature in full view. 

Reveal the map

Before you can react it suddenly blinks into the form of a bird and flies away.


###Boys attached to the control orb
You seen 4 peasant boys attached to a metal ring around the stone base, by thin chains.
There is a thug holding one of the boys hostage. "Not one step closer or the boy gets it!" The boy is wimpering in fear. 
Little Claw you notice 1 of the other boys is using the distraction to inch closer to the thug, his hand under the rags pulling out a small knife.

He strikes the back of the thigh with the knife. The thugs roars out in surprise and pain, drops the boy and falls to the ground. The boy with the knife pull the other boy back and they bother back away as far as the chains allow. The thug turns and lunges for the boys

All get an attack of oppertunity

After you kill the thug the back away as from you as the chains allow, the one with the knife standing guard.

If they try to break the chains, 1 of the boys springs forward and stands between you and the chains with a hidden knife in his hands... "NO, if the chains are broken we die!"

Portal still open. No sounds transverse the 

####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
