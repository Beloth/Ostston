Enter the Woods, encounter with Hell Hounds.

Trace the tracks 3 DC 14 Survial checks. (2 Done rquires 1 more)
- Fails lead to clearings with encounters. 
- Success leads to a Standing Circle and they end there. There is an opressive feel to the area. Air is heavy with magic. 8 foot tall stones 5-6 metres in diameter. 
	
Need Wisdom saving throw of 15.

- Fail "you eyes skim the stones nothing important there. You start to move away from the stone" 
- Success "you feel something external making you want to turn away from the stone circle. You fortify your self and with a shake of you head you brush off the suggestion. You see the stones but for some reasonyou can see what's inside."
	
In the centre of the stone circle lies an altar, bare except for a large crystal glowing with a red light. The crystal slowly pulses, almost like a heart beat. By the altar there seems to be a large portal into which several people are slowly shuffling through they all have a blank look on their faces. Around are 5 people dress in guard uniforms. There's 1 either side of the portal as well as 1 with his hand on the crystal. As they see you they push the final 3 people through before turning to face you. The one holding the crystal takes his hand away and the portal closes. The crystal loses its red tint. Its now a pulsing with a sfot white light. He yells "In Charion's name" and they attack.

4 will fight to the death. Sargent yell "Talget we must leave" Mage will open new portal on other side and he flees through leaving the Sargent behind. If captured they will refuse to speak. If forced they will start before collapsing and threashing on the floor grabing the arm that has the tattoo before a buring starts from the tattoo incinerating them. 

Behind the alter there is a backpack containing 
- A cloak of Protection
- 2 Potions of Healing
- 75 Gold
- A pouch with 4 Jasper gems

as well a Staff of the Python.

If you touch the crystal you hear a booming voice in your head... "You are not one of mine". The crystal turns red and there is bright red flash and an arcane explosion. 2D4 damage Acrobatics save DC 10 to half the damage. 
	
Above the now red crystal forms a red mist and within that mist an indistict form appears. "Well what do we have here... More tributes perhaps.. no none of you are mine, well that's not entirely true is it." Mal you can feel a feeling of kinship towards the being. "now what to do with you..." "Perhaps you have something to offer me for letting you live?"
	
"No I think not. I can't have you interupting my plans." With that the crystals begins to pulse even faster and brighter. All of you feel something probing your minds.
	
Arcana check DC 10 - Its calling something to come to this place
	
Wisdom DC 15 save Mal with a Disadvantage
	
- Fail
  - Mal "These people will never accept you. They already distrust you. Its only a matter of time before they turn on you. Take the 1st strike" 
  - Angus "These people are after you power. They know about the stone. You mustn't let them take the power. Stop them before they take it from you"
 - Cig "How can you trust these people. You only just met them. They won't trust a thief. They just lulling you into a fasle sense of security. Betray them before they betray you"
 - Little Claw "How can you trust these people? They kill the creatures of the land so easily and with no remorse. They see them as beasts, pests to be removed. They would kill you family as easily as they kill the others after all they are just peast.. they see you as a pest.. stop them"
 - Eli - "He still keeps the whistle. The only link to you family. He's hiding it from you.. stopping you from finding them. He's the one that took them, he's trying to get rid of the evidence"
	 
The voice in your head is persasive and you belief it. You turn on your companions

- Success The voice it trys to persuade you but reach deep within for your sense of self you brush aside the attempt to control you.
	
Each time you take damage do a new Wisdom check DC 15
