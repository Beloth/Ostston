#Next Session - 30th June

###Last Session

The party Enacted their plan to infiltrate the camp. They watched as the Packmaster went on patrol then sneaked into the hut that seemed to contain the leader of the camp. There they found a Tiefling who Mal attempted to convince that he was there for a report on the camp. This deception failed and the rest of the party launched into action. After a brief fight they subduded the Tiefling and held of the horde of controlled civilians while Angus worked out how the control belt worked. He managed to give them a command to stop attacking. The party then woke the Tiefling up and casting Detect Thoughts by Mal and Suggestion by Angus the party questions her. They learn many things amoung which is she is Mal's half sister (Pelarna) and that he has many other siblings , some of which (Melanor, male fighter and Pelgora, female fighter) are working, like her, with the master who is against their mutual father.

####Dwarven trade caravan
As the group travels through the forest passive perception 15+ Something catches your attention, you motion for the rest of the group to stop and be quite, make a perception check.

Perception check: 
                 Nat20 you hear a deep male voice shouting out a battle cry to the North West   
                 20+ Shouting coming from maybe 500m the North West and the sounds of battle  
                 15+ Shouting coming from the North West and the sounds of battle  
                 10+ You briefly thought you heard so shouts but it was so short you weren't able to pinpoint a direction  
                 5+ Was probably nothing.  
                 
On one of the main trails through the forrest is a Dwarven trade caravan being attacked by:

1 Packmaster + 2 Hellwolves (2000xp)

Defended by 4 Dwarves  
1 Merchant  
1 Dwarf Guard captain (Level 6 Fighter)  
2 Dwarf Caravan guards (level 3 fighters)  

The Dwarves are holding their own and you can see the dissolving remains of maybe 3-4 other devils, but just as the party arrives an additional 

1 Packmaster + 2 Hell wolves (2000xp)

They are headed to Iradell (avoiding Ostston so not to have to pay the new tax). Taking metal works as well as some refined metals. If pressed will also tell the group that they have several uncut gems that.

####Evening

If killed Pelarna in cold blood or killed any innocent people  

#####Mal's nightmare

You are floating infront of the same tower, the 4 eyed visage above. You suddenly curl up in agony as something is pulled from you. Through the pain you see the images of those innocent people you killed are torn from you and are sent towards the tower. You see them trying to escape the pull of the tower, crying, begging to be freed but you can do nothing as they are consumed by the image above the tower. Finally Pelarna's image is drawn from you. Unlike the others her struggle seems partially successful. Her movement towards the tower is slower and you can see the strain on her face. Finally she tears free and heads upwards with a trumphant smirk on her face, which fades as her journey upwards is halted and another force jerks her back down but instead of heading towards the tower she is pulled in another direction. As you focus on the direction she is traveling you can faintly see what appears to be the top of another tower in the far distance 

If killed by other members of the party you see the images of those dead float past you into the tower.

Mal wakes from the nightmare. Wings have grown to a 2 foot wing span. Disadvantage to any Dex based rolls as you are unuse to them. They throw off you're centre of balance. 1 week.




####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
