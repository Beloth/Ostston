####Cig's capture

The party finds Cig unconcious along with 3 bodies of the kidnappers. Around them are 3 people dressed in dark clothing, hoods up with with only theirs eys visable above the cloth covering the rest of their faces. 1 in kneeling is front of Cig while the other 2 take up defensive positions when they spot you, with their daggers drawn, blood still dripping from them. 

"Stand down" the kneeling woman says as you approach, "their his friends". They sheath their weapons but maintain their defesive positions. Cig comes to conciousness when the woman waves something under his nose. After a moment she helps Cig to his feet.

Once Cig is able to stand by himself she removes her hood and pulls down the cloth covering her mouth. You recognise her as the woman that you met you showed you to the meeting place for the thieves guild (and the tunnels).
