###Last Session 30 - 16th Dec

* The party was lead to a stairwell down by the Ghost of the high priestess Floryn Fernwood. As you headed down you ran into a blockage. Using some tools you managed to create enough of a gap to sqeeze through.
* Once the whole party was through you started your exploration of this level. You avoided several patrols of thugs as well as imps and found one of the secret passage that the High Priestess talked about.
* This passage lead to several guarded rooms. After defeating the guards you found that one of the rooms had been converted to a prison for Archanist Shaniera. You free her and ask how she came to be captured. She tells you that she and her helpers that were still studying the portal and crystal were surprised and overwhelmed. Her helpers were killed and she was knocked out and brought her. 
* After continuing to find a larger guarded room which contained several dozen captives, all of whom have a slave collar on and are simpling sitting in the room. You decide that you need to find the slave collar controller before releasing them.
* You find the next secret passage that the High Priestess told you about but by the exit of the passage was blocked by some guards. You manage to defeat them plus some reinforcments from a nearby room that heard the fighting. The room contained many things including Shaniera's equipment


###Next Session 31 - ?

####Runes blocking the ghosts
* The walls have runes carved in the stone that make up the barrier stopping the ghosts from getting through. They are old however and partially hidden by the dirt and moss growth that has occurred. Runes are infernal in nature
* Perception Check DC 15+ to spot the runes if not looking for them or Investigation check DC 10+ if actively looking
* Arcana check 
  * 10+ old runes that appear to be designed to keep things out
  * 15+ They were designed to keep everything out including you. Must have weaken over time
  * 20+ Given a few more months, at most a year, they will have degraded enough that the ghost could probably have breached it.
* In order to break it down completely you need to find the power cluster. 
  * Investigation check
    * 10+ You spot a cluster 
    * 15+ You sport mulitple clusters
  * Arcana check  
    
Power crystal
Runes - Flow
        Stability
        Regulate
* Breaking 1 power cluster weakens the barrier in that section. Need to break several inorder to alow the ghost through

####Door 1
* Solid metal door.
  * Investigation
    * DC5 - No lock, no handle.
    * DC10 - Newly installed door 
    * DC15 - Doesn't seem to be any obvious method of opening the door
    * DC20+ - As you inspect the door more closely you can just about make out some sort of markings on the door. It looks almost like some sort of writing. (What languages do you speak? In ancient infernal - make an intelligence check DC 15+ to get an understanding. Seems to be invoking protecting and or defense)
    
  * Attempting to open the door. No lock no handle so how are you trying?
    * Pushing on the door make a strength check. No matter the roll no affect. If high roll (25+) you push so hard you actually do damage to yourself (1D4 damage)
    * Attacking the door physically. Roll attack AC 10+. If hit roll damage - as soon as you make contact with the door an explosion of force erupts. 
      * Everyone within 10 feet of the door make a Dex save closest DC15+, next DC10. Success takes half damage. Damage = 2xDamage rolled.
    * Attacking the door with magic. As you release the magic you see writing start to light up. Shaniera's eyes widen and she shouts out "RUN". Everyone within 30 feet of the door make a Dex saving room. Closest DC17, next 15, next 13, next 11, etc. Anyone successful manages to scramble out of the way. All that fail take 2D6 magical force damage and are knocked prone. 
  
  * If the writing is spotted and mentioned then Shaniera will have a look. She takes out from a small pouch at her side what looks like a eye monocle. She places it in her eye and takes a close look. "Hmmm obviously magic, recently empowered. Looks like someone doesn't want anyone entering in here." 
      

####Main Room

? Think about lair actions. Center of Meilikki's power but corrupted. If still corrupted bad actions hurt party. If cleansed good actions help party.
* The room is dominated by a large statue of a horned Devil with a large wing span. 4 large eyes glowing eerily.
* The centre orb is has thick reddish black veins growing up from the base. The parts not covered by the veins is glowing a sickly blue colour.
* In the Centre you see a large winged fiend slumped to 1 knee surround by some sort of force field. A line of energy connecting it to the center orb.
* Red lines of power leave the central orb hitting 2 tieflings standing by the orbs. You see their faces twisted in ecstasy. They are visibly vibrating with energy, wings outspread. 
  * Passive perception 15+ You also see smaller lines of purply blue energy leaving them and hitting the other orbs
* In front of the statue a rift appears to be forming

* If Mal gets within 20ft of the centre orb a line of power lances out from it striking him in the chest
  *  Wisdom saving throw 10+. Every round increases difficulty by 1
    * If failed. You are overwhelped by a feeling of ecstasy. You utter a low moan of pleasure and are unable to resist the pull of the power line as it moves you 10 ft into position infront of the closest orb
    * If successful movement reduced to 5ft.
  * Will continue to try to connect until Mal leaves the room or the mage goes away.  
  * For every turn attached +1 to wings
* Ameria has an Ioun Stone Protection, Wand of the War Mage +1, potion of greater healing, Spell Scroll of Clairvoyance
