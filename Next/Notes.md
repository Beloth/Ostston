#Next Session

###Last Session
They sent a message to Hillard Tower via a bird that they failed to return the villages but found the portal and mage. Attempted to head to Ostston but found that there was an orc camp to the west blocking their way. Attempted to go round but was found by a patrol which they defeated but one escaped to raise the alarm. They avoided the rest and headed instead to the Wayfair inn. There the drunk themselves into a stuper on free ale. They informed the local Sargent of the orc camp who sent a patrol to scout it out

They then reached Ostston and rented rooms in Spring Well Inn. Little Claw and Eli went to Winyfred's Wonderous Wares where Little Claw looked into sending a message (6gp)
The rest went to the Palace and talked to the duty officer then to the High Marshal about the situation. Got the gold for the 3 present then Angus used magic to pretend to be a young male Eli and got that share.

###This Session
####Initial description
Meeting back at the Inn?

####In Ostston
Time to shop and explore

####Summons to the council
A few days later they recieve a summons to the council to explain the situation.
They are escorted through the busy hallways by 2 guards. Lots of people wlking though the hallways, servants, guards and others. You are lead into what appears to be a throne room where there appears to be a queue to one of the side doors on the other side to which you are being lead

Perception check (DC18+)
You notice a figure hiding in the shadows that appears to be watching you

you enter what seems to be a waiting room where 2 guards stand by the door. A clerk sits at a desk and motions to some seats. Please take a seat the council will see you soon

Perception check

* 10+ you hear raised voices but can't really make out what is being said
* 15+ their is an obvious disagreement within the council. Several are disbelieving
* 20+ Male voice seems to be the most veriment in his disbelieve and calls into question the envidence

####Council Room
Well appointed room with high ceilings and a large glass window letting in a lot of light. Large rectangle table dominated the room arround which sits the council. At the head is Lady Gellantara, Lord Tanafrey, Steward Belorn and Archanist Shaniera on her right and Priestess Val'oren, High Merchant Xavier and High Marshal Felarn on her left.

High Marshal Felarn stands and introduces you to them. Lady Gellantara and councillors this is the party who brought news of Hillards fall and the portal to which our subjects were taken through.

"Hmm they don't look like much." The figure sitting at the right hand of Lady Gallentara (Lord Tanafrey)
"Their tale matches with the reports I'm getting" replies Felarn
"Reports that are obviously too late for us to do anything about" retorts Tanafrey
"And the Marshal of Highcastle will pay for his incompetancy. You was it that pushed for his promotion in the 1st place!"
"Why you..." Tanafrey looks to stand
"Enough!" shouts Lady G "Enough this arguing will get us no where"
"Agreed" the female half elf. "perhaps questioning this party would be a better use of our time than rehashing old arguments"
She turns to you "tell me of this portal and the one who held it open"

Lady G
"Thank you for your time... you will receive a bonus.. High Marshal Felarn please take care of it and show them out" A clear dismissal of Felarn. Tanafrey looks smug

Felarn walks you out and takes a pouch from the clerks desk. "Follow me." He takes you to what is obviously his office. Gives you the pouch (holds a further 500gp)
"I had hoped the council will allow me to boost the number of guards due to your testimony but Tanafrey obviously has the ear of Lady G at the moment and has blocked that. I can't afford to go directly against him at this time." "If you are interested I may have jobs for you in the future, but I will need to wait a while otherwise it would be too obvious. That is if you are interested?"

"In the mean time if you are looking for work you could head to the Order of the Anvil. Grand Master Bannor is an old friend. Here I'll right you an introductory note".
