#Next Session

###Last Session
Questioned clerk you shrugged off Angus sugestion spell and lied through his teeth. Mal murders him without the rest of the group knowing.  
They take the gold, open the trap door and head down the stairs. Open the door to see a thug flee. Cig pushed into the room by Mal and is ambushed by a thug hiding by said door. Kill him and chase after the thug. Mal triggers a poison arrow trap but is unharmed. Easily finds the hidden door (not well hidden) and walk to the next door they open it to be immediately fired upon by 2 thungs crouching behind some crates. Mal rushes in and is ambushed by the run away thug who is hidding by the door.  
They see Caelom tied to a chair plus 2 mages near him. After firing a spell or 2 one of the mages flees though another door. The remaining mage when she thinks she is on the verge of defeat thrusts a dagger into the chest of Caelom before overloading herself with magic and exploding. But she misjudges the distances and fails to harm anyone except kill Ciad's physical form.
They heal Caelom (remove the magic dampening restraints) and he urges them to stop the other mage destroying evidence.  
They find the room on fire and the mage dimension doors out. They brave the fire to try to gather as much evidance as possible. They eventually are over come by the heat and flames and are forced from the room. Cig passes out in the room but Little Claw uses thorn whip to drag him out. The other door leads to the sewers and Cig suggest they leave as the sewers will be used by less savoury people. Little Claw hears voices and the group decide to leave  
After a rest Mal attempts to sneak out of the inn but see a fire in the noble quarter. The party finds that Lady Granrus's estate is on fire. They try to help. Little Claw uses otter form (for some reason). Mal finds 2 burnt bodies and cuts 2 fingers off each as well as attempts to find some silver ware to steal. Litte Claw rescues Jooves by using Ape form and Handfeet.   


###This Session

####Caelom is up
After another nights rest Caelom is up and eager to find out more. Talks to the party to find out what happened and why they werer there. Suggests he heads back to the Jolly Workman to get a change of clothes before heading to the library to talk to the investigators.

#####Library
* This is too much 1st a rogue necromancer now 2 more rogue mages. Clearly they are making this all up for some neferious reason.
* Caelom coldly parts his robes to see the scars that were inflicted on him. "Are these made up!"
* Both Trent and Rasvull stare at the scars and Rasvull visibly deflates.
* Trent "Very well, this investigation is closed. However one into these rogue mages will have to be opened. I will confer with Senior Investigator Ronon. Robert I would like you to be present when I report this". "The rest of you are free to go".
* Caelom "be warly. Someone is obviously interested in you if the tracking spell is anything to go by"
 
#####Talk of the city
* Fire at Lady Granrus's
* Death of a prominent merchant's son.


####Summons to the council
Returning to the Springwell Inn they recieve a summons to the council to explain the situation in 2 days time.  
They are escorted through the busy hallways by 2 guards. Lots of people wlking though the hallways, servants, guards and others. You are lead into what appears to be a throne room where there appears to be a queue to one of the side doors on the other side to which you are being lead

Perception check (DC18+)  
You notice a figure hiding in the shadows that appears to be watching you

you enter what seems to be a waiting room where 2 guards stand by the door. A clerk sits at a desk and motions to some seats. Please take a seat the council will see you soon  

Perception check

* 10+ you hear raised voices but can't really make out what is being said  
* 15+ their is an obvious disagreement within the council. Several are disbelieving . Also hear talking about the death of the son of the merchant Athar. He is raising a fuse and a proper investigation should be done.
* 20+ Male voice seems to be the most veriment in his disbelieve and calls into question the envidence  

####Council Room
Well appointed room with high ceilings and a large glass window letting in a lot of light. Large rectangle table dominated the room arround which sits the council. At the head is Lady Gellantara, Lord Tanafrey, Steward Belorn and Archanist Shaniera on her right and Priestess Val'oren, High Merchant Xavier and High Marshal Felarn on her left.

High Marshal Felarn stands and introduces you to them. Lady Gellantara and councillors this is the party who brought news of Hillards fall and the portal to which our subjects were taken through.

"Hmm they don't look like much." The figure sitting at the right hand of Lady Gallentara (Lord Tanafrey)  
"Their tale matches with the reports I'm getting" replies Felarn  
"Reports that are obviously too late for us to do anything about" retorts Tanafrey  
"And the Marshal of Highcastle will pay for his incompetancy. You was it that pushed for his promotion in the 1st place!"  
"Why you..." Tanafrey looks to stand  
"Enough!" shouts Lady G "Enough this arguing will get us no where"  
"Agreed" the female half elf. "perhaps questioning this party would be a better use of our time than rehashing old arguments"  
She turns to you "tell me of this portal and the one who held it open"  

Lady G
"Thank you for your time... you will receive a bonus.. High Marshal Felarn please take care of it and show them out" A clear dismissal of Felarn. Tanafrey looks smug  

Felarn walks you out and takes a pouch from the clerks desk. "Follow me." He takes you to what is obviously his office. Gives you the pouch (holds a further 500gp)  
"I had hoped the council will allow me to boost the number of guards due to your testimony but Tanafrey obviously has the ear of Lady G at the moment and has blocked that. I can't afford to go directly against him at this time."  
"If you are interested I may have jobs for you in the future, but I will need to wait a while otherwise it would be too obvious. That is if you are interested?"

"In the mean time if you are looking for work you could head to the Order of the Anvil. I'll write you an introductory note which will get you a meeting with Roszana who is incharge of the handing out the contracts.

####Exploring the Merchant Quarter
If the prosperity of a city can be determine by the amount and varity of the goods sold by it merchants that by all accounts Ostston is a very prosperous place. There are merchants here selling everything from spices to furniture to magic items.

Perceptions check 
* 10+ the is a subtle undercurrent of worry
* 15+ Though there still appears to be many things on sale there does seem to be a number of empty shelves

After a time exploring

Angus make a perception check

* 10+ You think you saw somthing important but you don't know what or why
* 15+ You saw something in one of the shop windows that bugs you. Thinking back and using your keen mind you recall the shop selling wooden items, chairs, tables, musical insturments, wait, there it is, the whistle, exactly the same style as Eli's.

####Order of the Anvil

As you approch it is less of a guild hall and more of a massive stone fortification 3 stories high. 2 heavily armed guards stand at the side of the thick open wooden doors. You can see several guards standing on the roof looking down.

You enter a large central hall which is busy with people. Several desks are at the sides manned by clerks with queues of people waiting to talk to them. Many large notice boards are scattered around the hall with what appears to be little notes pinned to them. There are clusters of people around the boards looking at the notes and a few taking some down.  

Several clerks holding piles of notes walk through the hall putting new notes onto the various boards.  
One of these clerks walks by you and stops "You look lost. Can I help you?"

"This is the contracts hall. Each of those boards holds various jobs that the guild has taken on. Guild members, adventuring parties and mercanaries bands can have a look and if a job looks like something they would be interested in completing they take the note to one of the desks, gets more information and signs up for it".  

You have a message for Lady Lemia? Very well" He flags down a clerk who had just finished pinning up new jobs on a nearby board and hands him his stack of jobs "Follow me" He leads you to a side door that has 2 guards standing by. "Wait here" He knocks and enters closing the door. Hard to here over the noise of the hall.

Door opens and the clerk beckonds you in. 
You see a female hafling sitting behind a large desk that has several trays full of the same job notes in them. "You have a message for me? Quickly now I'm very busy"  
"Hmm a recommendation from the High Marshal, you don't see many of those around"  
"I am the Mistress of Contracts here at the Order of the Anvil. Do you know how the contracts work?"  
"Those contracts out there" She waves towards to door "are for junior guild members who have yet to prove themselves to the guild, unaffliated adventuring groups and mercenaries"  

"They are generally not the best paids jobs but need to be done"  
"The more lucative jobs are saved for proven guild members. Now this note from the High Marshal says you have done him a good turn and he would look upon the Order favorably if we were to accept you"  
"Do you wish to join the Order?"  

"While the Marshal's note does paint you in a good light you will need take on a contract and be assessed by a qualified member before we classify you as being proved, and I have just the job and possibly you assessor"  
She shuffles through some paper "Yes here we are. There's mausoleum north of the city that needs to be cleared out of undead. The family wishes to bury a recently deceased member. You will be joined by Thorath Ironshield a cleric of Torm and a repected member of the Order."  
"I'll send word to him to me you at the Hall's enterance at dawn tomorrow."
