#Next Session No 27 - 28th Sept

###Last Session

* Defeated a Barbed Devil
* Slept in Angus's magical house. When they walk out they see a small bird waiting for them. When Eli emerges the bird talks to her in her Uncle's voice tell her that he had found some of their tribe at to meet him her the old ruins
* They find him and he directs them to an old tunnel/sewer. Leading them through you found a cavern under the rebuilt ruin where there appears to ba a mound of bodies and bones. Dangling from the ceiling is a rope from what appears to be a trap door.
* 2 Carrion Crawlers 
* Uncle Eldorin leads you up and seems in a hurry to find the members of his tribe. He waits impataintly as Caid scouts ahead and once the all clear is given runs off ahead.
* The party follows but Eldorin gains a lead over them and vanishes into a room and out of sight. As the party enters the room a solid stone slab drops and blocks the enterance. They try to exit through the door opposite but slam into something solid
* A Female half elf appears and monologs at the party. Part way thorugh the speech Uncle Eldorin appears beside her and she starts to pet his hair. The party notices a collar around his neck. She then leaves them with Eldorin following her
* The runes around the room started to glow and slowly the life starts to drain from the party. You started to inspect the runes to try and find how to escape. Magic didn't seem to work as any spell just fizzed out. Not only that but the mage hand glove that Angus made lost its magic when Cig tried to use it within the room.
* Destroyed the runes in a certain order to free yoursef and the try to pry the door open as the glowing crystal in the middle start to glow brighter. You hear Tharlin on the other side help you. You manage to raise the slab enough to crawl thorugh before it slams down again and there is an explosion within the room.

####Portal Room

4 Altars with bodies on them. Their chests have been opened up and glowing crystals are next to their beating hearts. Eli and anyone with passive perception of 15+ notices that one of the bodies is Uncle Eldorin

Encounter 

2 Cultist, 2 * 150 = 300  
4 imps, 4 * 100 = 400  
1 Bearded Devil, 1 * 700 = 700  

Total = 1,400xp  

As the encounter ends the crystal's glow is dying out and the portal is flickering and reducing in size. Eldorin is looking at Eli and trying to reach out with his hand.

#####Uncle Eldorin

* "I'm so sorry little one." You see blood dribbling from his mouth.
* Any healing spell cast on his causing him to cry out in agony. You see the wounds try to heal but after a second they re-open and the crystal momentarily brighten.
* "I thought I could protect myself but she was too strong."
* "Its too late fore me but I saw several of your cousins go though the portal. They will be used in whatever ritual she has planned on the other side. You must rescue them"
* "I can hold on long enough for you to go though the portal".
* He reaches up and pushes a stray hair and tucks it over your ear and you are reminded of all the times he had done that in your childhood.
* "Be strong... I will always be with you." He pulls your head down and places a bloodied kiss upon your forehead. 
  * Perception check dc12+ As he pulls back you see his eyes glow briefly.
* "Now go!" He lays back on the stone altar and screws his face in concentration and the crystal begins to glow brighter and the portal aperture grows. 
* As you approach the portal he screams in rage and the portal opens wide enough to travel though.
* You spare a brief look back you see him looking at you and smile through the pain. Just as you walk backwards though the portal you see his eyes glaze over as his body begin to disintergrate and turn into ash and the portal begins to shrink again

####The portal travel.

* the first few through
  * You've travelled via portal before and that was instantaneously but this one is different you feel like you are travelling fast though a long tunnel (imagine stargate travel). You see an opening which you assume is the exit but instead on passing through you actuall bounce off and vector off through another shorter tunnel and thrown out.

* Last 3 are thrown out of the portal 
  * You've travelled via portal before and that was instantaneously but this one is different you feel like you are travelling fast though a long tunnel (imagine stargate travel). You feel as sharp turn and you are thrown out  
    * Arobatics or Dex save DC10+ 
      * Failed 1D4 damage as you fall 10ft from the opening and fail to long properly
      * Success no damage.
  

####Evening

If killed Pelarna in cold blood or killed any innocent people  

#####Mal's nightmare

You are floating infront of the same tower, the 4 eyed visage above. You suddenly curl up in agony as something is pulled from you. Through the pain you see the images of those innocent people you killed are torn from you and are sent towards the tower. You see them trying to escape the pull of the tower, crying, begging to be freed but you can do nothing as they are consumed by the image above the tower. Finally Pelarna's image is drawn from you. Unlike the others her struggle seems partially successful. Her movement towards the tower is slower and you can see the strain on her face. Finally she tears free and heads upwards with a trumphant smirk on her face, which fades as her journey upwards is halted and another force jerks her back down but instead of heading towards the tower she is pulled in another direction. As you focus on the direction she is traveling you can faintly see what appears to be the top of another tower in the far distance 

If killed by other members of the party you see the images of those dead float past you into the tower.

Mal wakes from the nightmare. Wings have grown to a 2 foot wing span. Disadvantage to any Dex based rolls as you are unuse to them. They throw off you're centre of balance. 1 week.



###Temple

Crystal similiar to the one the party destoryed in the 1st clearing. Cultist surrounding it chanting. It flicks in time with the stone portal.


####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
