#Next Session - 30th June

###Last Session

Little Claw searches of mules and they head in that direction. On the way the party find a trail at the end of which they find a group of hell wolves surrounding the body of a dwarf. After defeating the wolves they search the body to find it was clutching a leather pouch hold a normal stone. The decide that this dwarf was obviously trying to act as a decoy and the head back up the trail. They find the original ambush site where several dwarves are fighting a pack master, several wolves and imps.

They defeat them all with the loss of 2 of the Dwarven guards. The remaining guard points them in the direction where the true Heart Stone had been taken. The party follows the it till they find a a dead body with several cultists, wolves and imps. 1 of the imps grabs a package from the dead body and instantly turns invisible. The party defeats the rest of the opposion but does know where the imp with the package went.


###This Session

####Clearing
While resting the Dwarven warrior finally catches up with the party. As he enters the clearing he spots the party resting and his eyes falls on the body of the dwarf. Seeing no enemies he drops his weapon and heads towards the body where he drops to his knees, places his hand on the chest of the dwarf and shuts his eyes. After a minute of silent pray over the body where you can see the conflicting emotions on his face he gathers himself. "You will be avenged!"  

#####Tharlin Ironhammer
* Stern
* Angry at the death of his cousin
* Oath of Vengance against his killers
* Suspicious of the Sages of the Arcane


It was our contact within the Sages that told us to avoid Ostston. She described the troubles in the city and surrounding countryside and told us that while longer, it would be safer to avoid such areas. They have alot to answer for. When then clan leaders hear about this there will be consequences.

But 1st we must get back the Heart Stone. You seem to know what's going on. Where do you think they will take it?
If they talk about the south west fort. 

"You mean near the old ruin? You mean they're rebuilding that? I thought it was cursed? That whole area is.. haven't you heard the tales? The lake sits where there used to be a large town which was destoryed ages ago. Some say a mad mage destoryed it when he tried to empower an ancient artifact, others say that it was taken into another dimension. Whatever the actual cause there was a huge magical backlash that destoryed the surrounding area and created a huge crater which eventually filled in to form the lake.

I could join you.... or I could head back to Dar Thak and gather some of the lads.

####Heading to the South West Fort.

Encounter with a Barbed Devil (1800xp)

####South West Fort

The fort is not temporary structure. You can see the stones buildings being created centering around a multi-storey tower. It all looks incomplete but the tower is already 2 storeys high with a 3rd level being built. There is also the beginings of a stone wall being built around the fort, replacing what seems to be a temporary wooden wall.

* Quite a few sentries. 
* Mixture of devils and other races (cultists, slaves, tieflings and mages)
* Be hard to sneak in.

####Eldorin

A [Common_Chaffinch] (http://identify.whatbird.com/img/4/63082/image.aspx?x=322) swoops down towards Eli. It lands in front of Eli, open's its beak and the voice of Eldorin speaks

"Eli come quick. Found where they are holding some of our tribe. South West of the lake. By the old ruins. Meet there"




#####Reason for the dwarven trade caravan

They were approached my a member of Sages of the Arcane. They were going to be building a hall at the University and wanted the dwarves to craft them a heartstone to a certain specification. It was suggested the we head though the forrest to avoid Ostston duties.

Arcane check

Nat 20: A heartstone is a powerful magical artifact. It acts as the centre or heart of a warding scheme. The more complex a warding scheme the bigger the heart needs to be. There are several flavours of heartstone, for example dwarven made ones tend to complement a rigid scheme, one achored in stone or earth. Elven made ones are more flexible and better in natural, living enviroments. Powering a heartstone takes time as it generally absorbs some of the surrounding magical energy and slowly gains strength however it is possible to push power in to it but this should be done with great care as if too much power is pushed too quickly there can be unforseen consequences

####Evening

If killed Pelarna in cold blood or killed any innocent people  

#####Mal's nightmare

You are floating infront of the same tower, the 4 eyed visage above. You suddenly curl up in agony as something is pulled from you. Through the pain you see the images of those innocent people you killed are torn from you and are sent towards the tower. You see them trying to escape the pull of the tower, crying, begging to be freed but you can do nothing as they are consumed by the image above the tower. Finally Pelarna's image is drawn from you. Unlike the others her struggle seems partially successful. Her movement towards the tower is slower and you can see the strain on her face. Finally she tears free and heads upwards with a trumphant smirk on her face, which fades as her journey upwards is halted and another force jerks her back down but instead of heading towards the tower she is pulled in another direction. As you focus on the direction she is traveling you can faintly see what appears to be the top of another tower in the far distance 

If killed by other members of the party you see the images of those dead float past you into the tower.

Mal wakes from the nightmare. Wings have grown to a 2 foot wing span. Disadvantage to any Dex based rolls as you are unuse to them. They throw off you're centre of balance. 1 week.



###Temple

Crystal similiar to the one the party destoryed in the 1st clearing. Cultist surrounding it chanting. It flicks in time with the stone portal.


####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
