#Next Session

###Last Session
While alone Mal and Angus investigate the scoll left to Angus by Lady Granrus. They discover that it is a old manuscript, describing the levels of hell, that was copied from another version. Mal notes that it appears to have 2 of the levels mixed up (3rd and 5th). The next day they head to the Order of the Anvil to turn in their contract and become members of the guild. Rosanne confirms that the ey were successful and outlines the benefits of membership while handing them their reward. She also sends word to the High Marshal. They annouce that their group name is "The Hand".  
They then headed to the Temple of Moradin to see whether they have found a way of ridding Angus of the cursed Opal. They meet an old Dwarf call Dorn Runebrow who explained that the Opal is not strictly cursed but is part of a magical item set called "The gems of Sidruis". The opal is the slave gem and provides the master gem's owner the best characteristic of the owner of the slave. They were popular centuries ago with noblility who used them to improve their children and they were originally completely volunteery. However the extreme cost of them caused many shortcuts to be taken leading to the gem Angus currently holds were there where no safeguards in place. The clerics go on to describe the 2 possible methods of neutralising the curse. Either find the master gem and used that to remove the link or find someone who who take on the curse from Angus.  
All the party bar Angus head back to the mausoleum to look for the master gem. They find the mausoleum locked up and after Cig lockpicks the door they head in. Mal searches the urns but is disappointed only to find ashes. They head to the stairs to the lower part but find the tomb has been moved back to cover then and no amount of pushing will budge it. They remember that there seemed to be a mechanism to opening it and proceed to activate it. As they do they notice that there appears to be a growing glow around the tomb. They rush down to find that all the bodies have been moved and the area cleaned. As they head back to where they found the Opal they hear noises coming from the other tombs. Believing that they have tiggered the re-animation of more undead they rush forward and start searching for anything them missed the first time. Although the chests had been returned to the hidden room they were now empty. Also the 2 suits of armour had been returned to their upright position and they were starting to shake. Having seemly outstayed their welcome they rush to the exit attempting but failing to lock the door behind them.  
Meanwhile Angus headed to the slums in Ostston but just as he reached the outskirts he is turned away by the city guards. They inform him that the slums are dangerous at the moment as there seems to be a turf war going on and that he would be advised not to enter while they try to return order to the area. He turned away and searches for a begger in other parts of the city, which he finds Dorran. After a brief discussion he persuades him to take on the opal for a lump sum and a stippend. He takes him back to the temple while plying him with drink. Once there the clerics warn Angus of the danger of ritual but agree to go ahead with transferring it to Dorran. The clerics gather and lead by Runebrow the ritual starts. By expending his magic while the tendrils of the curse are moved from himself to Dorran, Angus manages to shield them both from some of the damage cause. However as each tendril is moved then amount of hurt caused increases and by the time the last tendril is moved, Dorran has past and Angus is at the brink of death. As the acolytes rush to aid the clerics and Runebrow who have been left exhusted by the ritual, Angus is lead out of the room to recover.  
The rest of the party return to discover what has happened. Insensed by what he percieved as Angus's lack of remorse over the death he caused, Little Claw lost himself and transformed into an Ape attempted to assault Angus. Unfortunately in his rage he misjudged the distance and failed to land a blow. Mal, seeing the city guard about to intervene casts sleep on Little Claw and drags him away. 
The next day they head to the palace to talk to the Marshal where they inform him of the undead in the tomb. He tells them that he has other people investigating the issue including Archanist Shaniera but at the moment leads are rather thin on the ground. He suggests that they start the investigating the toys they found where they rescued Caelom. They ask him to see if he could find Weester and he agrees to spread the word to the guard and get back to them. The Marshal also provides some knowledge of the disturbance in the Slums but is surprised when Angus suggests that it might be linked to the Shadow League. He confirms that while there is a thieves guild operating within the city there has been no evidences of a world wide organisation called the Shadow League. The Marshal is willing to give the party access to his own contact within the thieves guild, a silk merchant.  
Some of the party then try to find Weester. They stake out the home he disappeared in when being followed by Eli and Cig but find nothing. They then head to the safe house that he used to store a disguise. There they find a drunk man asleep, and after sombering him up they question him about Weester but gain no useful information.





####Investigation 

You will be rewarded for any informtion you bring me regarding these cultists and where our missing citizens are. Awaiting the results of the Sages investigation into the rogue mages and the crystal pieces. Archanist Shaniera is also do some investigation herself. As you leave you notice Lord Tanafrey talking urgently to a female elf. If you try to hear them they will spot you and fall silent and sneer at you and walk away. If you was about her you find that she is an advisor to Tanafrey. Lady Yordel. Magic user. Aloof. Doesn't talk to many people.

#####Toys
Marshal suggests visiting the craftsman quarters.
Investigation check DC 10+ After wondering around the craftsmans quarters you notice that several shop signs have small patterns similar to the ones on the toys on them
DC 15+ you find a sign with the same symbol as Eli's whistle.

Talking to the owner, the marks indicate which apprentice made the item. It was a pratice brought in long ago. He points to a wall where many symbols hang. These are all the apprentices that learnt their craft in this very shop and have gone on to greater things. 

Looking at the whistler "Yes this is something we would have an apprentice make. It would help teach them precision" "While we do try to sell them to give a bit of additional income to the appentice, they rarely sell so we tend to wait till there is a small stockpile and then donate them to a local orphanage." The last one would have been about a month ago to the Our Lady's orphange just outside the city to the East. It is about an hours walk from the city. Not necessarily that particualr one.

#####Orphanage
Seems very quite. Metal fence, gate appears wide open. If they look round the back there is what appears to be a recent burial. Front door slightly ajar. As you search the place it looks deserted. 

######Office
Ransacked. Nothing of value left. Dried blood on the floor.

######Dining Room
Rows of tables for maybe 30 people plus a raised table. On the raised table appears to be bowls of food for 5 people.

#####1st floor
Several empty dormitories

#####Attic

######Bedroom
Appears to be a dormintary setup several beds and wardrobes. Perception DC15+ noise coming from one of the wardrobes. 
Open the door DEX DC5+ roll to avoid a dagger strike from a young girl(10ish) (Attck roll 1d20 damage 1d4)

Convince her that the party is there to help: DC10+ . Several (4) other children emerge from the wardrobe. All younger than the 1st (4-6)
Told them how a bunch of people came about a tenday ago. Nana had us hide. Heard lots of screaming and crying but stayed hidden. When no more noise came out. Found Nana dead. Buried her out back.

Eldest gets the rest to go downstairs to finish their meal. She tells the party that before she came her she used to live on the streets and she recognised some of the language the men were using. Thieves cant.

####Silk Merchant
Enter a very richly decorated store. Several manikins with silk robes and dresses, selves packed with rolls of silk of various colours, displays with silk ribbons. Several customers being helped by shop assistants. A very rich looking female standing in front of a mirror drapped is a rather lurid pink being attended by a young human male. As you move into the shop you catch some of what he is saying:

"The colour looks magnificent with you're complextion, it really brings out that healthy glow of your skin". As he spots Mal, "Ah there you are" He turns back to the female "Please excuse me, this young gentleman has an order for his bride to be" He waves to one of the free assistants. "Cheral please continue to help this young lady" Smiling he loops his arm around Mal's and leads him towards the back of the shop "Your wife to be will love this... its a beautiful pale blue showing off all the right things, you'll be the envy of all your friends... "  

Once your in the back he drops his smile and unhooks his arm. Putting his finger to his lips he beckons you to follow him. He leads you to a small office and once the door is close slides a small panel across and reaches in. "There, we won't be overhead for a bit". He moves to a cupboard where he takes out a box wrapped in a pale blue bow as well as a short ribbon of the same colour.  

Perception check DC15 see a small rune stone inside with is now glowing slightly.

"I don't know why you want to contact the Thieves guild and I don't want to know. All you have to do is walk through the central market with this box and a pouch with whatever message you want the guild to have inside and tied with this ribbon. The message with reach the guild and if they like what the message says you'll be contacted"

"Best get back" He leads you back to the shop floor and as you get back out "A pleasure as always and please remember to come back if you or you lovely young lady are is need of anything else" He heads back to the previous customer.

####Thieves guild

Old gnome sitting behind a desk. Round glasses pearched on his nose. Seems to be going through a ledger. Perception check to see that it appears to be columns of accounts. Money coming in from various gangs and their payment.  

"Shadow League!" he shouts. The guards perk up and you see them stare at you, hands on their weapons, they are ready to attack on the gnomes order. He sighs "There isn't a Shadow league but some fool has started getting some people together and calling themselve the Shadow League. And now some rich fool gets off'ed there's suddenly a grand conspircy and the Shadow League is responsible. Do you know how badly this will affect business! Bah of course you don't. As if I didn't have enough trouble with those rufflers in the slums"   

"Hmmm" he peers at you though his glasses "Maybe we will be able to help each other. This gang calling themselves the Shadow League have holed up in the slums. We don't know whether they have taken over the Slumies or working with them. They have removed everyone we have sent in to check on them. Whats worse is they have sealed all of the underground ways into the slums. All but one... but this one must be guarded by something as everyone one we have sent have dissappeared.
