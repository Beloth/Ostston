#Next Session - 30th June

###Last Session

The party followed a path north from the protal clearing. The noticed they were being followed and attempted to set up an ambush by climbing up some trees.While there they are surrounded by Hell Wolves so they attempt to flee of the backs of conjured giant owls. A devil packmaster appeared as they were about to do so and downs the owl carrying Cig forcing the party to fight. During the fight a druidic Halfling appears with his companion wolf Rebel to help. After defeating the devils the halfling is revealed to be Eli's Uncle Eldorin who ushers the party quickly away. He leads them to a hidding whole where is becomes apparent that he's not all there.

After Little Claw casts lesser restoration on him his mind becomes clearer and he tells the party what he knows. Mal convinces him that he has a important mission to help the remaining memebers of his tribe. THe next morning the party awakens to find Eldorin gone. They decide to head to the camp to the east

They manage to avoid most of the shape changed imps who are keeping a look out to discover a large clearing. Reaching the edge of the camp, the party sees a large number of what appears to be prisoners with collars arounf their necks. They also see a few guards around who also appear to be collared. A patrols of hell wolves enters the camp and heads to one of the buildings from which emerges another of the fiends that they had just fought.

###This Session

####Thoughts
All the slaves:  

No surface thoughts. They are completely blank if not given a task. With a task their thoughts are completely focused on completing it. If dig deeper thoughts are muted but general dispair. A few of the stronger willed people the deeper thoughts come through a bit clearer and those are the ones that you see crying. See thoughts of vile acts done to them, them forced to do vile acts as entertainment, etc.

Of the Guards:  
Their thoughts are also muted but not controlled in the same manner as the slaves. They were willing to go along with whatever their masters wanted and so are given a greater amount of freedom. General boredom. Deeping excitment for what they will be allowed to do later, planning what they are going to do, dark thoughts.

Looking into the hut:  
Idle playing, toying, mild amusement  
Dispair, humiliation, praying ro be set free  

If you dig deeping into Pelarna:  
Underlying sense of boredom. If she senses the spell:  
Surprise and then you are suddenly blocked off 1D4 physic damage as you a forcefully removed from her mind.  

####Tiefling in the hut

Pelarna

Female tiefling with curled horns and dark red leathery wings

When she spots Mal:

* A sinister grin slowly starts to grow across her face
* "Welcome brother.... its so nice to have family visit."
* "So how is father? Must be getting rather desperate if he is sending you out so early"

If Mal looks confused

* The grin grows
* "You don't have any idea what I'm talking about do you..." She starts laughing almost hystrically
* After she gets herself under control "This is wonderful" Her eyes dancing with vicious glee...
* "Its almost a pity to have to do this" as she reaches for her belt "but we can't have you blundering around"
* "Capture them"

All the people turn to look at the party, they reach out and start walking towards you arms out stretched.

Pelarna ducks back into the hut. 
2 Hell wolves sitting behind the party

####Pelarna captured

She struggles against you.  
Spits at you, "I won't tell you anything"

Half sister. Same father. She found out more about her heritage. Her father was the Arch Devil Malchar. He is gathering power inorder to take one of the 9 hells over. 

Hundreds if not thousands of offspring. Breeding with powerful individuals trying to find some mystical combination. Those that don't meet the criteria are discarded like they are nothing. Your time will come, you too will be thrown away like I was.

"but I have found a new master. One that not only promised me power but actually gave me it" She stretches out her wings.

####Evening

If killed Pelarna in cold blood or killed any innocent people  

#####Mal's nightmare

You are floating infront of the same tower, the 4 eyed visage above. You suddenly curl up in agony as something is pulled from you. Through the pain you see the images of those innocent people you killed are torn from you and are sent towards the tower. You see them trying to escape the pull of the tower, crying, begging to be freed but you can do nothing as they are consumed by the image above the tower. Finally Pelarna's image is drawn from you. Unlike the others she does not struggle against the pull. She seems almost resigned as she shrugs her shoulders, turns towards the image and floats willingly towards it.

Mal wakes from the nightmare. Wings have grown to a 2foot wing span. Disadvantage to any Dex based rolls as you are unuse to them. They throw off you're centre of balance. 1 week.










####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
