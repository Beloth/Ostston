###Last Session 29 - 12th Dec

* Party headed back along their trail heading towards the temple
* They find what appears to be a large field of cultivated mushrooms that has become overgrown
* They follow a trail from the field that seems to lead towards the temple but it slowly veers away. They discuss following the trail or heading directkt to the temple. They vote 3 to 2 to head to the temple (Cig, Eli and LC) (Angus and Mal)
* Mal uses message and his actoring skill to message Eli pretending to be her dead Uncle Eldorin who wants her to follow the trail. This caused Eli to change her mind and they party heads down the trail
* They find an abandoned settlement with a dozon or so building. ELi and Cig sneak in and investigate the largest building. In it was a statue of a unicorn representing Mielikki who Eli says a prayer too
* The rest of the party also start investigating the building and Angus find several journals which give some information about what happen to the settlement and a few hints about the temple
* Before they leave there is a discuss on whether to take the statue. Again its a 3 to 2 vote and again Mal uses his whisper and acting combo to make Eli belief that her Uncle wants her to take the statue, which she does without the knowledge if the rest of the party.
* As they approach the temple they see the fleeing ghosts
* Inside the temple they see various ghost fighting air as they stand over their own skeletons. LC uses his death tokens over each skeleton which seems to be affecting the ghost. However during one of these prayers he distrubes one of the skeletons which causes the ghost to take notice of him. It possess LC and forces the other to knock him unconscious causing the ghost to resume its endless fight.
* They continue to explore and come across a ghost that seems to be praying over the skeletons. Unlike the other ghosts this one immediately notice they and turns towards them
* It recognises that Eli has the statue and demands that she return it. Eventually Eli admits to it and they find out that it belongs in one of the side chapels of the temple. After it is returned the party talks to the ghost who is the high priestess Floryn Fernwood who gives them important information.
