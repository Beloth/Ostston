He was the person who hired him and several others to pretend to be guards. They that finished their part and left a few days ago. The last lot of goods and people left at the same time He was the last one left and was due to leave in a a day or so. He will be escorted to Ostston to testify to the Grand Marshall. If you could also go to testify about what you have found that would be most useful and you would be well rewarded.

The tattoo was found on all the bodies within the tower but not on Len. They also checked the tribesman bodies but none seemed to have the tattoo.
