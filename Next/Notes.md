#####Toys
Marshal suggests visiting the craftsman quarters.
Investigation check DC 10+ After wondering around the craftsmans quarters you notice that several shop signs have small patterns similar to the ones on the toys on them
DC 15+ you find a sign with the same symbol as Eli's whistle.

Talking to the owner, the marks indicate which apprentice made the item. It was a pratice brought in long ago. He points to a wall where many symbols hang. These are all the apprentices that learnt their craft in this very shop and have gone on to greater things. 

Looking at the whistler "Yes this is something we would have an apprentice make. It would help teach them precision" "While we do try to sell them to give a bit of additional income to the appentice, they rarely sell so we tend to wait till there is a small stockpile and then donate them to a local orphanage." The last one would have been about a month ago to the Our Lady's orphange just outside the city to the East. It is about an hours walk from the city. Not necessarily that particualr one.

#####Orphanage
Seems very quite. Metal fence, gate appears wide open. If they look round the back there is what appears to be a recent burial. Front door slightly ajar. As you search the place it looks deserted.
