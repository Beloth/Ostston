###Last Session 30 - 16th Dec

* The party was lead to a stairwell down by the Ghost of the high priestess Floryn Fernwood. As you headed down you ran into a blockage. Using some tools you managed to create enough of a gap to sqeeze through.
* Once the whole party was through you started your exploration of this level. You avoided several patrols of thugs as well as imps and found one of the secret passage that the High Priestess talked about.
* This passage lead to several guarded rooms. After defeating the guards you found that one of the rooms had been converted to a prison for Archanist Shaniera. You free her and ask how she came to be captured. She tells you that she and her helpers that were still studying the portal and crystal were surprised and overwhelmed. Her helpers were killed and she was knocked out and brought her. 
* After continuing to find a larger guarded room which contained several dozen captives, all of whom have a slave collar on and are simpling sitting in the room. You decide that you need to find the slave collar controller before releasing them.
* You find the next secret passage that the High Priestess told you about but by the exit of the passage was blocked by some guards. You manage to defeat them plus some reinforcments from a nearby room that heard the fighting. The room contained many things including Shaniera's equipment
