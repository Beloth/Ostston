#Next Session

###Last Session
They sent a message to Hillard Tower via a bird that they failed to return the villages but found the portal and mage. Attempted to head to Ostston but found that there was an orc camp to the west blocking their way. Attempted to go round but was found by a patrol which they defeated but one escaped to raise the alarm. They avoided the rest and headed instead to the Wayfair inn. There the drunk themselves into a stuper on free ale. They informed the local Sargent of the orc camp who sent a patrol to scout it out

They then reached Ostston and rented rooms in Spring Well Inn. Little Claw and Eli went to Winyfred's Wonderous Wares where Little Claw looked into sending a message (6gp)  
The rest went to the Palace and talked to the duty officer then to the High Marshal about the situation. Got the gold for the 3 present then Angus used magic to pretend to be a young male Eli and got that share.

###This Session
####Initial description
Meeting back at the Inn?

####In Ostston
Time to shop and explore

####Summons to the council
A few days later they recieve a summons to the council to explain the situation.  
They are escorted through the busy hallways by 2 guards. Lots of people wlking though the hallways, servants, guards and others. You are lead into what appears to be a throne room where there appears to be a queue to one of the side doors on the other side to which you are being lead

Perception check (DC18+)  
You notice a figure hiding in the shadows that appears to be watching you

you enter what seems to be a waiting room where 2 guards stand by the door. A clerk sits at a desk and motions to some seats. Please take a seat the council will see you soon  

Perception check

* 10+ you hear raised voices but can't really make out what is being said  
* 15+ their is an obvious disagreement within the council. Several are disbelieving  
* 20+ Male voice seems to be the most veriment in his disbelieve and calls into question the envidence  

####Council Room
Well appointed room with high ceilings and a large glass window letting in a lot of light. Large rectangle table dominated the room arround which sits the council. At the head is Lady Gellantara, Lord Tanafrey, Steward Belorn and Archanist Shaniera on her right and Priestess Val'oren, High Merchant Xavier and High Marshal Felarn on her left.

High Marshal Felarn stands and introduces you to them. Lady Gellantara and councillors this is the party who brought news of Hillards fall and the portal to which our subjects were taken through.

"Hmm they don't look like much." The figure sitting at the right hand of Lady Gallentara (Lord Tanafrey)  
"Their tale matches with the reports I'm getting" replies Felarn  
"Reports that are obviously too late for us to do anything about" retorts Tanafrey  
"And the Marshal of Highcastle will pay for his incompetancy. You was it that pushed for his promotion in the 1st place!"  
"Why you..." Tanafrey looks to stand  
"Enough!" shouts Lady G "Enough this arguing will get us no where"  
"Agreed" the female half elf. "perhaps questioning this party would be a better use of our time than rehashing old arguments"  
She turns to you "tell me of this portal and the one who held it open"  

Lady G
"Thank you for your time... you will receive a bonus.. High Marshal Felarn please take care of it and show them out" A clear dismissal of Felarn. Tanafrey looks smug  

Felarn walks you out and takes a pouch from the clerks desk. "Follow me." He takes you to what is obviously his office. Gives you the pouch (holds a further 500gp)  
"I had hoped the council will allow me to boost the number of guards due to your testimony but Tanafrey obviously has the ear of Lady G at the moment and has blocked that. I can't afford to go directly against him at this time."  
"If you are interested I may have jobs for you in the future, but I will need to wait a while otherwise it would be too obvious. That is if you are interested?"

"In the mean time if you are looking for work you could head to the Order of the Anvil. I'll write you an introductory note which will get you a meeting with Roszana who is incharge of the handing out the contracts.

####Exploring the Merchant Quarter
If the prosperity of a city can be determine by the amount and varity of the goods sold by it merchants that by all accounts Ostston is a very prosperous place. There are merchants here selling everything from spices to furniture to magic items.

Perceptions check 
* 10+ the is a subtle undercurrent of worry
* 15+ Though there still appears to be many things on sale there does seem to be a number of empty shelves

After a time exploring

Angus make a perception check

* 10+ You think you saw somthing important but you don't know what or why
* 15+ You saw something in one of the shop windows that bugs you. Thinking back and using your keen mind you recall the shop selling wooden items, chairs, tables, musical insturments, wait, there it is, the whistle, exactly the same style as Eli's.


####Winyfred's Wonderous Wares

[Winyfred's Goods](https://github.com/Beloth/Ostston/blob/master/Locations/Ostston/places/Winyfred's%20Wonderous%20Wares.md) 

#####If Angus tries to get a mage guild discount
Winyfred wants to see his guild identification. "Guild identification please". As he has none the shop keeper sighs at him. "Oh dear. 1st time outside the University without your sponsor is it? No.. hmm strange your sponsor should ahve gotten you guild identification. You'll need identification before I can give you any discount"

If Angus says you never needed it before. "Where have you been shopping? At a non-guild approved shop. Here in Ostston?"

"Hmm Highcastle was it.. well not my problem. But it'll be wise of you to report them but thats your call"

"Now for identification.. I can help you there for a small fee" Pointing to a display cabinat filled with various rings, amulets and trinkets "Just select one of these to be the basis of your identification then I'll talk to the Magistar to get your membership details"

After choosing the item she picks up a small hand mirror from beneath the desk. With a small arcane gesture he calls out "Magistar of registration office"  
"This is Winyfred's Wonderous Wares" and he holds up an amulet, which glows briefly, to the mirror. A voice comes from the mirror "How may I help Miss Winyfred" "well it appears I have a Wizard here without the proper identification".  
She twists the mirror round so that its facing Angus

Old Female gnome. Grey hair tied in a bun. Half moon spectacles. The mirror appears to be sitting on the desk that she is sitting behind. Several crystals in holders on the edge of the desk. She picks a clear one up and holds it infront of the mirror. "Name" After giving his name: There is a bright flash from the crystal that momentarily blinds Angus and anyone else in from of the mirror. When his sight returns the crystal is back in the holder and a large opne book has appeared infront of the gnome and the pages are flickering rapidly and the stops. The gnome starts reading.

"Angus deSchwarz MAcDonnach hmmm" "age 30" "Sponsor Robert Caelom" "Junior Lecturer on 'The magical embodiment in ancient architecture ... ' " ends in a mumble "hmm that's strange there's a sealed note on your file 1 second please" The mirror goes dark as some music is heard coming from the mirror.

See if party does anything

There is a bell ring from the back of the shop After a time the gnome reappears "Right well I've sent the identification cystal to Winyfred's however Investigator Ronon would like a word with Lecturer Macdonnach" With that she hands off the mirror to a middle aged male human. "This Senior investigator Ronon. There are issues with the investigation into the necromancer. You are to help the further investigation. It is good that you are in Ostston. Meet with Investigator Trent at the Library immediately"

####Library of Ostston
Large well maintain building with steps leading up to the front enterance. The entry hall has a curved desk with several people seat behind dealing with what appears to be paper work. As you approach one looks up    
"Can I help you?"

"Identification please"  

He consults another book. "Investigator Trent, yes of course. 1 second please" and he touches a blue crystal on the desk. A door to the side opens and a young man approches. "Please take Lecturer MacDonnach to room 18"  
"Yes Sir" He turn to you "Please follow me"  
He leads you to the door he just came through and proceeds to lead you through several hallways before stopping in front of a closed door. He knocks. "Lecturer MacDonnach and party for you"  

"Enter"

You enter the room to see a large table with various papers scattered all over it and 3 people appear to be shifting through them. 1 male human, 1 female elf and 1 male dragonborn

Angus recognises the Dragonborn as Rasvull a member of the Sages of the Arcane who had always been vocally opposed to your rise in the guild.

The human walks towards Angus. "Welcome, I am Investigator Trent, these are my companions Dalee and Rasvull."

"We went to investigate the Necorancer you recently defeated however when we found the cave in which you claim to have defeated him no traces of him or any magical ritual or any magic was found. Further more the farmer and his daughter you claim to have saved weren't there. No one it that area had ever heard of them"

"We wished to speak to your mentor Robert Caelom however he never responded to the summons. He was last sighted here in Ostston looking into rumours of a lost manuscript being found by one of the noble families. And by some conicidance you are here too...."

Rasvull "As I've said many time this upstart has lied through out. Making up claims to justify his advancement. I bet Caelom finally found out and this pack of thugs dealt with"

Dalee "There is no proof of that Ras. In fact there is no proof of anything, that is the most perplexing part of this."
She turns to you "So when was the last time you saw Robert?" 

"And you have had no contact since? None at all?"  

Rasvull "We should hold them. They are suspects in all of this"  
Dalee sighs "Ras, there is no evidence of any wrong doing by MacDonnach or any of his party. We can't not hold them"  
Trent "This is true. Be warned you will be watched and if you do anything against the guild charter you will be punished, you are free to go"  
Dalee "I will show them out"  
As you exit she puts her finger to her lips and motions for you to be silent and to follow her. She leads you towards the enterance but before getting there goes in a side room. "Apologies but I thought it best to talk to you outside the meeting. Rasvull has his own agenda and Trent, well lets just says is looking for advancement and so doesn't want to make waves"  
"Robert was a friend so I want to find out what has happened to him. While I can't order you to investigate, in fact as an Investigator on this case I would have to strongly suggest you stay out if it, it is not my fault if you accidentally found these notes" She takes some parchment out of her pockets and leaves it on a desk "and decided to take matters into your own hands" With that she winks and leaves the room

####Notes on Caelom's Disappearance
Come to Ostston within a few days of MacDonnach's hearing  
Stayed in the Jolly Workman's Inn in the Craftsman quarter.   
Paid for a month room and board in advance  
Paid visits to muliple nobles houses in the Nobles quarter  
Asked about many of them  
Particularly interested in Xavier, Granrus, Darrel and Tanafrey  
 
####Jolly Workman's Inn
The innkeeper tells you that a man matching Caelom's discription did rent a room for the month and that he still has a week and a bit worth of rent. However he's unwilling to till you which room as you do not appear to be anytype of offical.

"You can let me go now I promise to to try again" If you hold on "you really should let me go now" and you feel a slight pressure you your groin area. You look down and see she has a dagger pressed against you.

####Getting to Caelom room
If inn busy Stealth roll of DC 10+
if quiet Stealth roll of DC 15+

If discovered chucked out of the inn by half orc bouncer and told not to come back or they will call the guard.  

####Caelom's Room
Locked DC10+ Dex check
to get in

Once in Angus perception check DC14+ if successful knowing Robert's routines you note that it appears to have been searched before but things put back in place almost as if he had done it.  

Investigation check DC 13+  
* Fail you notice the single book sitting on the bedside table. 
* Success As well as the book. In the pockets of one of the robes you find a note with what appears to be directions.

#####Caelom's Book
Angus recognises the book as one of many that Robert had in his study. They were linked to his notebook so that what ever he wrote in the notebook would appear in the symatheptic book. The symatheptic book would also appear to be one of the normal books on The Natural History of Hestal (volume 13) unless open in a special way.

Arcana check
* Failed the book appears to be inert
* DC5+ take 1D4 damage as spark of magical feedback hits you 
* DC10+ You almost had it but the true book remains hidden
* DC15+ it opens reveling the true book

Angus has not taken the investigation into his handling of the Necormancer well. Hopefully getting out of my shadow and a bit of adventuring with out me will dampen that arrogance that may hamper his future advancement in the guild.

A few uninteresting entries

Word has reached me through one of my contacts in Ostston that a rare Manusrcipt has been unearthed. I think I'll head there and investigate. Anything to get away from that pain in the arse Rasvull.

Skip a few entries

Talked to my contact and it appears that Lord Darrel has the Manuscript. Will try to gain an audiance to talk to him but 1st need to find a place to stay. The Jolly Workman was recommended as being close to the noble quarter and at being a decent price

I think I'm going to have to talk to my contact about taking money for recommendations. Thats the only reason I can think of for why he recommended me this inn. The innkeeper was nice enough and even gave me a good deal on a months rent. However its in the craftsman quarter and who in their right mind wants to be woken up before dawn by the ringing on hammers!

Met with the steward of Lord Darrel but was unable to convice him to let me talk to the Lord

Those damn hammers!

Gained an audiance with Lord Darrel. He was helpful enough but unfortunately sold the manuscript on. He did mention that what he wad told the manuscript contained information on the lower planes.

Started to ask around about who might be interested in the lower planes in the city and so might have bought the manuscript

Hmmm Betsy provides a fine distraction from the early morning wake up. Unfortunely I doubt I can afford many such mornings. The foolish girl thinks that I didn't she her slip out with my pouch but she earnt it.

There appears to be several pages dedicated to some sort magical construct.

Arcana check 
* DC10 some variation on a silencing spell
* DC15 He appears to have been attempting to create a small localised silence spell taht could be cast on an item and that would last 8 hours. The diagrams of ears suggest where he wanted the item to go

Apparently word of my interest in the manuscript has speard. Lady Granrus has invited me to tea. She apparently has information on who bought the manuscript

#####Directions
Intelligence Check DC 13+ to try to match the directions up with Ostston
* Failed takes you 4 hours of wondering around, talking to people trying to match up locations to the directions   
* After an hour you manage to find where the directions lead too.

Leads to Lady Granrus house but need to ask around to find that out 

#####Lady Granrus
You knock on the door. A butler opens the door "Yes?"  
"Please wait here" In the hall way  
"Lady Granrus will see you in the morning room"  He leads you to a well lit room where Lady Granrus is reclining on a chaise longue

Lady Granrus is a middle aged lady in an expensive low cut dress. Heavily made up
"Visitors. How lovely." She looks you over "not the usual type that visit me I must admit... so what do you do?" She takes a sip from her wine glass. "Where are my manners.. Drink?"   
"My guests tend to want their privicy. why should I tell you anything" with a smile

Angus perception check
Success you notice a glint under the side table, it appears to be a ring. A ring you recognise as one belonging to Robert.

"Fine yes he was here. Unfortunately for him I ran into a little problem and my way out was to slip a little something into his wine" She looks with amusment at your glass.  
"It was merely a sleep potion though to be fair he looked pretty tired anyway. Then some people took him away"

"Luckily for you I didn't like the way my problem, how shall I put it, used me, so I had some associates follow them."  
"What would you be willing to give me for this information?"

Some sort of check
She is very clever and unlikely to do anything for free

"Very well, he was taken to disused warehouse outside of the north gate. I'll have someone show you the way"  
See rings a small bell and the butler enters
"Ah Jooves please have Weester direct these fine people to the place he has been watching"
"Of course milady".
 

####Order of the Anvil

As you approch it is less of a guild hall and more of a massive stone fortification 3 stories high. 2 heavily armed guards stand at the side of the thick open wooden doors. You can see several guards standing on the roof looking down.

You enter a large central hall which is busy with people. Several desks are at the sides manned by clerks with queues of people waiting to talk to them. Many large notice boards are scattered around the hall with what appears to be little notes pinned to them. There are clusters of people around the boards looking at the notes and a few taking some down.  

Several clerks holding piles of notes walk through the hall putting new notes onto the various boards.  
One of these clerks walks by you and stops "You look lost. Can I help you?"

"This is the contracts hall. Each of those boards holds various jobs that the guild has taken on. Guild members, adventuring parties and mercanaries bands can have a look and if a job looks like something they would be interested in completing they take the note to one of the desks, gets more information and signs up for it".  

You have a message for Lady Lemia? Very well" He flags down a clerk who had just finished pinning up new jobs on a nearby board and hands him his stack of jobs "Follow me" He leads you to a side door that has 2 guards standing by. "Wait here" He knocks and enters closing the door. Hard to here over the noise of the hall.

Door opens and the clerk beckonds you in. 
You see a female hafling sitting behind a large desk that has several trays full of the same job notes in them. "You have a message for me? Quickly now I'm very busy"  
"Hmm a recommendation from the High Marshal, you don't see many of those around"  
"I am the Mistress of Contracts here at the Order of the Anvil. Do you know how the contracts work?"  
"Those contracts out there" She waves towards to door "are for junior guild members who have yet to prove themselves to the guild, unaffliated adventuring groups and mercenaries"  

"They are generally not the best paids jobs but need to be done"  
"The more lucative jobs are saved for proven guild members. Now this note from the High Marshal says you have done him a good turn and he would look upon the Order favorably if we were to accept you"  
"Do you wish to join the Order?"  

"While the Marshal's note does paint you in a good light you will need take on a contract and be assessed by a qualified member before we classify you as being proved, and I have just the job and possibly you assessor"  
She shuffles through some paper "Yes here we are. The Tolnar Mausoleum and Dormak Firebeard"  
"Meet Dormak Firebeard at the Northen gate at dawn tomorrow"
