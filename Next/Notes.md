#Next Session

###Last Session
They found the teleportation circle. Fell for the gem trap and ambushed by the Hell wolves. On the way to Hallard Fort they were herded by some more Hell Wolves and stumbled into a clearing where 2 owlbears were being attack by Hell Wolves. They attacked and defeated both groups.

###This Session
####Initial description
With the destruction of the crystal the heavy feeling of dread and oppression that you had been feeling when you entered the forest has lightened noticably. However its not gone completely.
