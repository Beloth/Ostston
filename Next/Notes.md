#Next Session - 30th June

###Last Session

The party Enacted their plan to infiltrate the camp. They watched as the Packmaster went on patrol then sneaked into the hut that seemed to contain the leader of the camp. There they found a Tiefling who Mal attempted to convince that he was there for a report on the camp. This deception failed and the rest of the party launched into action. After a brief fight they subduded the Tiefling and held of the horde of controlled civilians while Angus worked out how the control belt worked. He managed to give them a command to stop attacking. The party then woke the Tiefling up and casting Detect Thoughts by Mal and Suggestion by Angus the party questions her. They learn many things amoung which is she is Mal's half sister (Pelarna) and that he has many other siblings , some of which (Melanor, male fighter and Pelgora, female fighter) are working, like her, with the master who is against their mutual father.

####Evening

If killed Pelarna in cold blood or killed any innocent people  

#####Mal's nightmare

You are floating infront of the same tower, the 4 eyed visage above. You suddenly curl up in agony as something is pulled from you. Through the pain you see the images of those innocent people you killed are torn from you and are sent towards the tower. You see them trying to escape the pull of the tower, crying, begging to be freed but you can do nothing as they are consumed by the image above the tower. Finally Pelarna's image is drawn from you. Unlike the others her struggle seems partially successful. Her movement towards the tower is slower and you can see the strain on her face. Finally she tears free and heads upwards with a trumphant smirk on her face, which fades as her journey upwards is halted and another force jerks her back down but instead of heading towards the tower she is pulled in another direction. As you focus on the direction she is traveling you can faintly see what appears to be the top of another tower in the far distance 

If killed by other members of the party you see the images of those dead float past you into the tower.

Mal wakes from the nightmare. Wings have grown to a 2 foot wing span. Disadvantage to any Dex based rolls as you are unuse to them. They throw off you're centre of balance. 1 week.

Description
Young male human, mid 20's, long brown hair, lose and all tangled. Beads of sweat rolling down his face. His robes were once of a fine material but now they are tattered and dirty, long rips and missing pieces, most of one sleave is missing probably having been caught on a tree as he was running

####Roland Zola
After defeating the wolves.  
He slumps to the ground, breathing heavily, obviously exhausted. He looks up to you.  
"Thank you, I can't thank you enough." He takes a deep breath "That should give me time to get away. You should leave too. If you're this deep in they'll kill you 1st and ask questions later"  
With that he tiredly clambers to his feet.

If questioned  
"Look.. I thank you for defeating them but I can tarry here. The longer I wait the more chance more will find my trail. They don't take lightly to people leaving."  

"I'm just an lowly appentice mage looking for a subject for my Duoklau dissitation (Angus - one of the many things a mages need to do to become a full fledged member of the Sages of the Arcane although he appears old to still be on his Duoklau, its one of the 1st steps)  

Insight check  

Nat 20 -  Obviously lying, you can see his eyes darting side to side and more beads of sweat appearing on his brow. He is also clutching what you believe to be his focus. He's obviously an appentice mage but the Duolane was not the reason he was here.

If success: As you lift the remains of the sleive away from his bicep you see the tattoo (previously seen on those who had taken over the tower)

Persuasion DC 13+ or Intimidation DC 10+  

"Look I know this doesn't look good but I can explain..... I was sent here to investigate what was going on. I'm the apprentice to Investigator Rensure. I need to get back to him to explain my findings. I'm sure if you let me go you'll be rewarded"

Insight check DC

20+ He's still lying to you. You get the feeling this is how he operates and probably why he's still an apprentice

10+ Not totally being truthful.

Persuasion DC 13+ or Intimidation DC 10+  
"Ok.. ok... look. I am an apprentice in the Sage's of the Arcane, or maybe that should be was an apprentice. But it was clear they didn't understand me... I me look at me 24 and still trying to pass my Duoklau. Most who joined with me are already on their Decklau or have already been made members. 


###Temple

Crystal similiar to the one the party destoryed in the 1st clearing. Cultist surrounding it chanting. It flicks in time with the stone portal.


####Archanist Shaniera & High Marshal Felarn
Robed female approaches the party. "We need to talk... follow me" Leads you to a private room. Holds the door open slightly longer than necessary, then shuts it.

Once again she places the golden egg on the table and the dome forms.
Drops the invisiblity spell to reveal High Marshal Felarn. 

"I apologies for the deception but things have taken a turn. Just after I had warned Tanafrey that his life might be in danger he convinced Lady Gallentara to allow him to bring more of his troops into Ostston and I don't just mean 1 or 2 more bodyguards. I'm talking about several divisions worth using the excuse of the riots in the Slums and the fact that I have had to send out the majority of my men to deal with the troubles to the north and the Orc camp to the east."

"What exactly made you beleive that he was in danger. Everything I am seeing now seems to imply that he is looking to takeover Ostston, by force if necessary. However you also seemd to imply that he might be being controlled?"

"His advisor? She's... " the Marshal shakes his head as if trying to clear his mind. He turn's to the Archanist "Shaniera?"

She frowns in concentration. After a moment her eyes widen and she starts mumbling under her breath while gesturing with her hands, a faint glow surrounds both her and the Marshal. "By the goddess.." She begins casting again and the glow fades. She turns to the Marshal. "It was subtle but there was a spell on both of us."

"What spell?"

"Some sort of complusion spell... I believe to make us less likely to ask questions about his advisor..."

"You said before that you could not find the source of the portals magic... what about the advisor?"

"Its possible but I would need to confirm it which will be difficult without revealing that the spell is broken. And if it is her we are in serious trouble... The magic that went into making that portal and that trap are beyond my powers. We are dealing with a highly skilled and powerful magic user and if she is backed by Lord Tanafrey's troops..."

####Mal's contact with the Lawyers

Next morning during breakfast a human male approachs the party. Mal recognises him as the Lawyer he had contacted before. 

"Your information has stirred up a hornets nest. You have been request to return to give an accounting."
