You find yourself infront of a door, it opens and the sound of hundreds of people clapping greets you as you walk through. You stand in the front of the main lecture hall of the University. All the senior lecturers and leadership of the Sages of the Arcane are there smiling and clapping slowing fading as the Headmistress approaches you and after a short speech hands you her staff of office levatiting you to the headmaster of the Sages.

As this happens you hear in a whispered "This can be your future... all you have to do is to stop the goings on in Blackpine forest. Destory the temple and I will help you gain the knowledge and power you wish..."

As the final words fade you glance up to see a visage with 4 eyes and horns at back of the hall slowly dissipating.

You find youreself in a clearing in Blackpine Forest with bow drawn. You see the bodies of several Hill Tribesmen as well as the dissipating forms of many devils.

You've done it, you've rescued them.

As you start untying them you hear in a whispered voice "I can make this come true, I can help you find your tribe... all you have to do is to stop the goings on in Blackpine forest. Destory the temple and I will help you find them all.

###Little Claw

####Dreams
#####Dream 1
You find yourself in the middle of a corrupted forrest. The trees withered and wasting away, the animals corrupted and no longer acting naturally. You are surrounded by hell wolves who are slowly stalking towards you, growling, red eyes gleaming. You reach within yourself for the energies that permeate the natural world and you sink to one knee, eyes down and place your hands on the earth. As you do so the energy pulses outwards and the growling stops. You look up to see the corruption being beaten back radiating from you. The forrest start to regain its natural look and as the changes washes over the hell wolves you see them being transformed back to the wolves they were before. They surround you nuzzling you in a joyous greeting    

As you start greeting them back you hear in a whispered voice "I can help you beat back the corruption, help to save the packs that call this forrest home.. all you have to do is to stop the goings on in Blackpine forest. Destory the temple and I will help save them all.

As the final words fade you glance up to see a visage with 4 eyes and horns at the edge of the forrest slowly dissipating.

###Mal
####Dreams
#####Dream 1
You find yourself floating infront of the same tower a beam of light linking you to the orb at the top. There is a difference this time. The tug towards that orb seems less strong.. in fact you feel another tug on you towards a different direction. You look in that direction and see another beam heading off in a different directly. This beam is fainter but getting stronger. Both are pulling at you and you can feel the strain between them. The strain starts to affect you as the new beam's pulling
becomes stronger and stronger. 

As the pain from the conflict grows, a whispered voice comes from the tower "My son... listen to me. You must trust me... all that I have done was for you... for your safety... you are now truely ready yet. Another has dug their claws into you but you resist but if you trust in me I can help you escape their clutches. They have started something that will be disasterous for Helgret"

An image of Helgret in flames assults your mind, the bodies of the inhabitants strewn about, some desocrated, some on fire. You see the body of your mother crumpled on the ground, eyes wide, vacant, dead...

The voice continues.. "Destroy the temple in Blackpine forest or this will occur..."
